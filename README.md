WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) - Working Branch
===

This is the working branch of the WCAG source documents.  Please offer pull requests on this branch instead of the Master branch.  This branch includes updates that the Working Group has accepted since publication of the latest version of the WCAG supporting documents (Techniques for WCAG 2.0 and Understanding WCAG 2.0).  The Working Group intends to publish new versions of these two documents twice a year and merges the working branch into the Master in preparation for these publication events.

Thank you for your interest in WCAG!
