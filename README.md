WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
===

This is the master branch of the WCAG source documents.  Please offer pull requests on the latest Working Branch instead of this one.  This branch represents the current published version of the documents.  Twice a year the source documents are updated to reflect changes in the WCAG supporting documents (Techniques for WCAG 2.0 and Understanding WCAG 2.0) and at that time the current working branch is merged with this one.

Thank you for your interest in WCAG!
