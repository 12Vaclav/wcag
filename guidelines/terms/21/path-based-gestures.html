   <p>a pointer-drag interaction where the pointer has to go through at least one intermediate point to trigger a function. It is not just the endpoints that determine the outcome of the gesture, the intermediate point(s) defines the gesture as requiring a specific path, even if the complete path is not defined.</p>
