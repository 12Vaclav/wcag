    <h4>Focus Appearance (Minimum)</h4>
    
    <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
	<p class="change">New</p>
    
    <p>When components receive keyboard focus, an area of the focus indicator meets the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The area is either:
        <ul>
            <li>at least as large as the area of a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> thick <a>perimeter</a> of the unfocused component, or</li>
            <li>at least as large as the area of a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of a <a>minimum bounding box</a> of the unfocused component, and no part of the area is thinner than 2 CSS pixels.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The area has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the colors when the component is focused and it is not focused.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> Where the area is adjacent to the component, it has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against the component or a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, the item with focus is not entirely hidden by author-created content.</p>

    <p class="note">In HTML the size of a component is measured up to and including the CSS border. If the component size is not programmatically available, it can be taken from a <a>minimum bounding box</a> around the visible area.</p>
    <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
