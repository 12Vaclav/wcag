   <h4>Parsing</h4>
   
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   
   <p>In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end
      tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain
      duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow
      these features.
   </p>

   <p class="note">This Success Criterion should be considered as automatically met for any content using HTML.  Modern browsers all have automatic error correction for parsing errors, and issues such as incorrect states or names due to a duplicate ID, or missing roles due to inappropriately nested elements are covered by different Success Criteria. This criterion can therefore be ignored as being redundant.  It no longer provides any benefit to people with disabilities in itself and should not be enforced or required for accessibility.</p>
   
   <p class="note">Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such
      as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not
      complete.
