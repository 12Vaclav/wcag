   <p>Content can be displayed at a minimum width of 320 CSS pixels without loss of content or functionality, and without
      requiring scrolling in the direction of text except for parts of the content which require
      two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.
   </p>
  
   <p class="note">The width of 320 CSS pixels is equivelent to a browser width of 1280 pixels wide at 400% zoom.</p>
   
   <p class="note">Examples of content which require two-dimensional layout are images, maps, diagrams, 
     video, games, presentations, data tables, and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while
     manipulating content.</p>
