   <p class="ednote">This is a proposed Success Criterion that has not yet been formally approved by the
      Working Group. Discussion of the issue is available in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/67">Issue 67</a>. To file comments on this proposal, please <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/new">raise new issues</a> for each discrete comment in GitHub.
   </p>

   <p><a>Functionality</a> which can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by <a>user interface components</a> and can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, unless the motion is <a>essential</a> for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity.</p>
   				
	<p class="note">This criterion concerns input through sensors which respond directly to motions such as tilting, shaking, or panning. It is not intended to cover indirect motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology.</p>
