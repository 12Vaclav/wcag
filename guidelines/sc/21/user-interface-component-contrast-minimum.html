  <p>All <a>essential</a> visual identifiers of user interface components have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 the immediate surrounding color(s), except for the following situations:
   </p>
   					
   <ul>
      						
     <li><strong>Thicker:</strong> A <a>contrast ratio</a> of at least 3:1 is required where the minimum width and height are at least
         3 <a>CSS pixels</a>, for the essential visual identifier.
      </li>
      						
     <li><strong>Inactive:</strong> Disabled or otherwise inactive <a>user interface components</a> are exempt from this requirement.
     </li>
      					
   </ul>
  <p>Note about <a>essential</a> visual identifiers of <a>user interface components</a>: 
    A visual indication that the component is interactive. This may be a border, edge, icon, or other visual indication (which does not rely on color alone). Focus and selection indicators represent separate states of the component which also must meet this requirement.</p>
