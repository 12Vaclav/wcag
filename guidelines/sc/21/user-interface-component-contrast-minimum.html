   <p class="issue">This is a proposed Success Criterion that has not yet been formally approved by the
      Working Group. Discussion of the issue is available in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/10">Issue 10</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/pull/128">Pull Request 128</a>.

  <p><a>Essential</a> visual identifiers of <a>user interface components</a> have a <a>contrast ratio</a> of at least 4.5:1 against the immediate surrounding color(s), except for the following situations:
   </p>
   					
   <ul>
      						
     <li><strong>Thicker:</strong> A <a>contrast ratio</a> of at least 3:1 is required where the minimum width and height are at least
       3 <a>CSS pixels</a>, for the <a>essential</a> visual identifier.
      </li>
      						
     <li><strong>Inactive:</strong> Disabled or otherwise inactive <a>user interface components</a> are exempt from this requirement.
     </li>
     
     <li><strong>User agent control:</strong> The color(s) of the user interface component and any adjacent color(s) are determined by the user agent and are not modified by the author.
     </li>
      					
   </ul>
  <h5>Notes</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples of <a>essential</a> visual indicators of <a>user interface components</a> may include (a border, edge, or icon) and current state (such as selection indicator, focus indicator) or other essential visual indication (which do not rely on color alone).</li>
   	<li>Under consideration: simplify this Success Criterion by setting the minimum color contrast requirement to 3:1 and removing any need for measuring thickness.
