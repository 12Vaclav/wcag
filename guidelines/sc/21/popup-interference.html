    <p>Except where the visual <a>presentation</a> of <a>popups</a> is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author, all of the following are true when <a>popup</a> content is visible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> <a>Popup</a> content does not obscure any part of its trigger content.</li>
    <li><strong>Hover:</strong> If a <a>popup</a> is triggered via pointer hover, then the pointer may be moved onto the <a>popup</a> content without loss of <a>popup</a> visibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> <a>Popup</a> content remains visible while any of its components, including the trigger, have focus.</li>
  </ul>
