    <p>Except where the visual <a>presentation</a> of a <a>popup</a> is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author, all of the following are true when a <a>popup</a> is visible:</p>

  <dl>

    <dt>Trigger</dt>

    <dd>The <a>Popup</a> does not obscure any part of its <a>trigger</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Hover</dt>

   <dd>If the <a>popup</a> is triggered via pointer hover, then the pointer may be moved onto the <a>popup</a> without loss of <a>popup</a> visibility.</dd>

    <dt>Focus</dt>

    <dd>The <a>Popup</a> remains visible while its <a>trigger</a> or any of its components have focus, unless the user takes an explicit action to close the <a>popup</a>.</dd>
