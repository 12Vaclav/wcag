   <p class="issue">This is a proposed Success Criterion that has not yet been formally approved by the
      Working Group. Discussion of the issue is available in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/75">Issue 75</a>. To file comments on this proposal, please <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/new">raise new issues</a> for each discrete comment in GitHub.

    <p>When content becomes visible as a result of a part of the page receiving keyboard focus or pointer hover, the following are true, except where the presentation of the content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author:</p>

  <dl>

    <dt>Visible trigger</dt>
    <dd>Either the additional content does not obscure any <a>essential</a> content within the triggering <a>user interface component</a>, or the additional content can be closed or repositioned by the user.</dd>

    <dt>Hover</dt>
   <dd>If the additional content is triggered via pointer hover, then the pointer may be moved over the additional content without loss of visibility of the additional content.</dd>

    <dt>Focus</dt>
    <dd>The additional content remains visible while the triggering user interface component has keyboard focus, unless the user dismisses the additional content.</dd>

  </dl>

      <p class="note">Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML title attribute.</p>
     <p class="note">Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups which display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.</p>
