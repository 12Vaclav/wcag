   <p class="issue">This is a proposed Success Criterion that has not yet been formally approved by the
      Working Group. Discussion of the issue is available in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/60">Issue 60</a>. To file comments on this proposal, please <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/new">raise new issues</a> for each discrete comment in GitHub.

  <p>The size of the <a>target</a> in relation to the visible display at the default viewport size is at least 44px by 44px for pointer inputs except:
   </p>
   					
   <ul>
      						
      <li>an alternative link or control has 44px by 44px touch target</li>		
      <li>link is part of a block of text and it has 44px x 22px touch target</li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>  					
   </ul>
   					
   <p>where px is a CSS pixel when the page is using the device ideal viewport.</p>
   					
<!--   <p>Except when a link or control:</p>
   					
   <ul>
      						
      <li>is not part of the primary purpose or function of the page OR</li>
      						
      <li>has an alternative link/control whose target does meet the minimum size requirements</li>
      					
   </ul>
-->   					
   <p class="note">Editor's Note: this criterion borrows the distinction of "coarse" and "fine" pointing
      devices from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#pointer">Media Queries Level 4 - Pointing Device Quality: the pointer feature</a> [[!mediaqueries-4]].
