   <p>Each of the following text styles of the page can be overridden with no loss of <a>essential</a> content or functionality.</p>
   
   <ol>
     <li>font family by at least one different font family</li>
     <li>foreground color by at least one different foreground color</li>
     <li>background color by at least one different background color</li>
     <li>line spacing (leading) to at least 1.5</li>
