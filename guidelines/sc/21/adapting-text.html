   <p>Each of the following text styles of the page can be overridden with no loss of <a>essential</a> content or functionality.</p>
   
   If the technologies being used by the author allow users to override the author-supplied values for the appearance of <a>text</a> (with the exception of <a>images of text</a> and closed/open <a>captions</a>), no loss of <a>essential</a> content or functionality occurs when the following are overridden: 
   
   <ol>
     <li>line spacing (leading) to at least 1.5</li>
     <li>letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 em</li>
     <li>word spacing to at least 0.16 em</li>
   </ol>

   <p class="note">Editor's note: The Working Group seeks to to include overriding text color, background color, and font-family as part of this SC, but is not yet able to identify a way to do so that is sufficiently testable.</p>
