   <h4>Adapting Text</h4>
   					
   <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
   					
   <p class="change">Proposed</p>
  
   <p>If the technologies being used allow the <a>user agent</a> to adapt <a>style properties</a> of <a>text</a>, then no loss of <a>essential</a> content or functionality occurs by adapting all of the following:</p>
   
   <ol>
     <li>line spacing (leading) to at least 1.5</li>
     <li>letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 em</li>
     <li>word spacing to at least 0.16 em</li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>Note: Examples of text which are typically not affected by <a>style properties</a> are open <a>captions</a> and <a>images of text</a>, which are not expected to adapt.</p>
  
   <p class="note">Editor's note: The Working Group seeks to to include overriding text color, background color, and font-family as part of this SC, but is not yet able to identify a way to do so that is sufficiently testable.</p>
