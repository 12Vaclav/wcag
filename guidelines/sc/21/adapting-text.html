   <h4>Adapting Text</h4>

   <p class="change">Proposed</p>
  
   <p>If the technologies being used allow the user agent to adapt <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20-Reference/#def-style-properties">style properties</a> of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#textdef">text</a>, then no loss of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#essentialdef">essential</a> content or functionality occurs by adapting all of the following:</p>
   
   <ol>
     <li>line spacing (leading) to at least 1.5</li>
     <li>letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 em</li>
     <li>word spacing to at least 0.16 em</li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>Note: Examples of text which are typically not affected by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20-Reference/#def-style-properties">style properties</a> are open <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#captionsdef">captions</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#images-of-textdef">images of text</a>, which are not expected to adapt.</p>
  
   <p class="note">Editor's note: The Working Group seeks to to include overriding text color, background color, and font-family as part of this SC, but is not yet able to identify a way to do so that is sufficiently testable.</p>
