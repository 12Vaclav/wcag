  <p>If a <a> single key shortcut</a> using only printing characters is implemented by the web page to activate a control, then a mechanism is available to do one of the following:</p>
  <ol><li>turn them off </li>
    <li>remap them to a shortcut that uses at least one non-printing key</li> 
    <li>remaps them to a string of as many as 25 printing characters.</li></ol>
