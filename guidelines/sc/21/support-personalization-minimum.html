   <p class="issue">
     For pages that contains interactive controls or non-essential content, one of the following is true:</p>
  <ul><li>a mechanism is available for personalization of content that removes non-essential functionality and content, and enables the user to add symbols to interactive controls for essential functionality, or</li><li>
essential functionality and content, and contextual information for essential functionality and content, is programmatically determined.
    </li></ul>
  <p>note</p>
  <p>
  If there is a linked to alternitve version that only has essential content and has  symbols on  interactive controls would pass this SC.
    <br/>
Additional definitions (if we like it): Essential functionality and content -  the mimimum functionality and content that is essential to identify the topic and fulfill the purpose of the content. 
    The purpose, or topic of the content should be identified in the page title (See 2.4.2 and 2.4.6) </p>
