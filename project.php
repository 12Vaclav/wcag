		<h1>Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG) Project Plan</h1>
		
		<p>Content on this page has moved to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Timelines/">AG WG Timelines wiki page</a>.
		
		<!--
		
		<p>This page contains the project plan for the proposed Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AGWG). The plan includes information about specifications and milestones indicated in the AGWG Charter. The dates below are tentative, used for internal planning purposes, and may change. </p>
		
		<p>The intent of the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is to publish updated guidance for accessibility frequently enough to reflect technology evolution but slowly enough to allow meaningful uptake of new guidance. The Working Group completed WCAG 2.1 in June 2018, and is planning WCAG 2.2 for November 2020. In parallel the group is working on a major restructuring of accessibility guidelines, code-named "Silver", whose first release is currently targeted for November 2022.</p>
		
		<h2>Milestones</h2>
		<p>The <a href="charter">Working Group charter</a> proposed initial milestones. Updates to those milestones will be provided here as needed.</p>
		
		<p>Last update: September 2020</p>
