			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p>This technique applies to pages created with markup languages, specifically HTML with CSS. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to identify failing situations where text is clipped. Some users with low vision or cognitive disabilities find that if they override the CSS of a web page they can read the content better. The WCAG Text Spacing success criteria requires that all content is still visible when the user changes the text, character, line and paragraph spacing within the tolerances allowed by the success critiera. </p>
			<ul>
     <li>Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;</li>
     <li>Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.</li>
   </ul>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Copy the following section for each example. Examples must have a title and a description, and usually have a code sample. Code samples should be elided if necessary to show the core of the technique without necessarily providing all the surrounding code that would also be involved. A working example link references a location where the technique can be shown working live.</p>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Example Title</h3>
				<p>Description</p>
				<code>Code sample</code>
				<p class="working-example"><a href="../../working-examples/{example-name}/">Working example of {Example Title}</a></p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="tests">
			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Tests must have a test procedure and expected results. Populate the following sections as appropriate. If a technique has multiple alternative testing approaches, add a new section with class="test" for each one, and put the test-procedure and test-results sections inside that.</p>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Step 1</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Result</li>
				</ul>
