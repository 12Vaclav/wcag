			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to provide the information needed to identify a control when all contents of a larger component are editable. This primarily applies to a large design canvas with multiple editable components with it.</p>
			<p>To meet this technique, add text that:
			<ul><li> is programatically and visually adjacent to the component, and</li>
			<li> states that all content is editable. </li></p>
			<p>As a best practice, also add a short instruction on how to edit the components as well though this is not required to meet the Success Criteria.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Design Canvas</h3>
				<p>A design canvas allows a user to edit all the design elements with in it. A user must hover over an element to access the controls.  If all the controls are displayed, it will clutter the page. Instead, text instructions are included at the top of the canvas stating that all elements within it can be edited by using the menu available on hover or focus.</p>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<p>For controls that progress or complete a process:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Identify a component where all sub-components within it are editable</li>
					<li>Confirm that all sub-components include controls that only display when pointer hover or mouse focus is over them.</li>
					<li>Confirm that the component includes text that explains that all content within it is editable</li>
					<li>Confirm that the text is visually and programmatically adjacent to the component that contains the editable components.</li>
				</ol>
			<p>Note: Where a page has multiple page variations (i.e., in a responsive design) controls should be tested in each variation. </p>
