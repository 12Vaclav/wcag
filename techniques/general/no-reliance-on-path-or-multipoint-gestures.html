			<h2>When to use</h2>
			<p>All technologies that contain interactive elements. The technique can be especially helpful when evaluating thrid-party extensions, plugins, or developer frameworks to be used embedded in content.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that all interactive elements that can be operated with a pointer using single-point activation (i.e, without path-based or multipoint gestures). When all functions can be triggered by single clicks or taps, they are accessible to pointer users.</p>
      <p>Note that it is not sufficient to ensure that interface components can be operated with a single pointer. It is also important to also ensure that all interactive elements can be operated with the keyboard, which assures operability by assistive technologies like speech or switch input that rely on the keyboard interface.

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<ul>
        <li>A website for calculating credit has input fields to specify the amount of credit, needed and a native select element to specify the payback period.</li>
        <li>A carousel can be switched to next and previous slide by activating arrow buttons.</li>
        <li>A map view has a zoom in and a zoom out button ([+] [-]) to change the zoom factor of the map, and arroe buttons in four directions to move the visible section to the sideward sor up / down</li>
        <li>A website showing the narrow design triggered when viewed on a mobile phone has a pointer-operable button to show a drawer menu sliding in form the left.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that the technique does not rule out the support of pointer gestures as long as all functionality can also be operated using single point activation.</p>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
          <li>Identify all interactive elements on the page (including custom elements).
					<li>Check that each interactive element can be operated with a single pointer, using click or tap, double-click or double tap, or long press.</li>
