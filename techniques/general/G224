         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>The objective of this technique is to provide users with the flexibility to access content according to their preferences. This is achieved by replicating the information from the non-customizable image of text as actual text, allowing users to adjust it based on their needs.</p>         
         <p>Recognizing the constraints faced by many organizations, such as website dimensions, the complexity of actors involved, and the variety of images of text found online, this sufficient technique seeks to enable users to customize text presentation. Simultaneously, it empowers people to create accessible content rather than refraining from action.</p>
         <div class="note">                  
            <p>While utilizing this sufficient technique fulfills the requirements, we recommend replacing the image of text with actual text instead of duplicating it whenever possible.</p>

         <h2>Examples</h2>
         <section class="example">
            <h3>Text duplicates the content of the image of text in a sensibly structured way</h3>
            <p>A marketing campaign banner presents information using an image of text that contains the campaign name, a description of the campaign and a click to action to land on the campaign page. The author has duplicated the image of text using a heading for the campaign name, using a paragraph for the description and using a link for the click to action. In this context the image has been considered as decorative. Users are able to adjust the presentation of text based on their needs.</p>
         </section>
         <section class="example">
            <h3>Text conveys the same meaning as the image of text</h3>
            <p>The image of text displays multiple details in a visually disorganized sequence. Merely duplicating the text image's context with text may not offer an optimal experience for many users. The author has supplied a visible alternative text beneath the image that communicates the same message as the image but in a more human-readable format.</p>
