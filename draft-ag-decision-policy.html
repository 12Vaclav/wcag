			<h1>Draft Updated AG WG Decision Policy</h1>
			<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This is a draft update to the <a href="/WAI/GL/decision-policy">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group decision policy</a>. The AGWG decided on <a href="/2023/06/20-ag-minutes.html#resolution01">20 June 2023</a> to replace the decision policy with the standard W3C decision policy.  The text here has been updated accordingly.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>The Working Group follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document</a> regarding decisions. This document provides additional detail about the consensus decision-making process. The Working Group updates this policy as needed, using the procedures of this policy to ratify the update.</p>
      
      <p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>

      <p>All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.</p>
