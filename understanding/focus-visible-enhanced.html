            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is clearly
               visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="../20/focus-visible.html">SC 2.4.7 focus visible</a> and defines a minimum level of visibility.
            </p>
            <p>For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard-like device (e.g.
               a switch, voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. Visible
               focus must also meet the needs of low-vision users, who may also be keyboard-only
               users.
            </p>
            <p>A keyboard focus indicator can take different forms, this success criterion sets a
               requirement to make it is clearly distinguishable.

               <h3>Keyboard focus</h3>
               
               <p>The keyboard focus is the point of interaction for someone using a keyboard. For environments
                  with a keyboard operable interface, the keyboard focus can be moved around the interface
                  in order to interact with different elements. Whichever element is being interacted
                  with has focus.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>In web pages some components may receive focus as a user presses the tab key to move
                  to that component and then use the arrow keys to select an option (e.g. tabs, menu
                  items). The item considered to be focused is whichever is being interacted with. For
                  example, if you tab to a menu and arrow-down to a menu item, it is the menu item that
                  is in focus as pressing enter would activate the menu item.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Some elements can take focus (such as the target of a skip link), however, it is only
                  when the element is operable by keyboard controls that this criterion applies.

               <p>The bigger the visible change the easier it is for someone to see, authors are encouraged
                  to make the change as large as possible. For example, a thick outline around the element.

                  <p>A <a href="#dfn-css-pixel">CSS pixel</a> is what developers use in CSS declarations like “width: 200px”, it is device-independent
                     and not to be confused with device pixels which vary depending on the physical pixel
                     density. <br />
                     The rest of this document notates CSS pixels as "px".

               <p>To establish if a focus indicator has a size equivalent to at least a 2px line along
                  the longest side: If a link is 90px wide by 30px tall, the indicator would need to
                  be have a minimum area of 180px square. (I.e. 2px wide along the longest side is 2
                  x 90px.)

               <p>The following 3 examples use a 90px wide by 30px tall button, therefore the surface
                  area requirement is 180px. The middle button is focused in each example.

                  <figcaption>Figure 2The inner outline is slightly smaller than the outer edge of the component, but using
                     a 2px thick indicator means it is well over the minimum requirement of 180px squared.

               <p>If controls change size across different variations of a page (e.g. in a responsive
                  design), it helps to use a proportionally sized indicator such as an outline or background
                  change. In that way you can be sure of meeting the size requirement.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>If controls change size and you use a fixed size indicator (such as an icon of a fixed
                  size) you would need to calculate the largest size a control could be in order to
                  provide an indicator that meets the size requirement across variations.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Typical focus indicators:</p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>An outline around the whole component would pass the size requirement;</li>
                  
                  <li>Changing the background of a control would pass the size requirement;</li>
                  
                  <li>A 1px wide vertical line (such as a blinking cursor) would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement, a text input would need a larger or separate focus indicator.
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               
               <p>If you need to use complex mathematics to work out if a focus indicator is large enough,
                  it is probably a sign that you should use a larger and proportional indicator that
                  will provide a more visible indicator.
               </p>

                  <h4>Unusual shapes and gradients</h4>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>If you have an unusal shape, some mathematics may be required if the focus indicator
                     is on the edge of the size requirement. For example, if the focusable control is a
                     circle with a diameter of 100px, the bounding box of that component would be a square
                     of 100px on each side. If the focus indicator is also circular, then the area needs
                     to 100px * 2 = 200px.
                  </p>

                     <img src="img/focus-indicator-circle.png" alt="Two orange circlular buttons with an icon in the middle. The right hand circle has a dark outline around the whole cicle to indicate focus" width="150" />

                  <p>The circumference of a 100px diameter circle would be 314px (diameter * π), therefore
                     a 1px outline around the cicle will be 314px of surface area, meeting the requirement
                     for a 200px surface area.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>If a focus indicator is an irregular shape, such as a drop-shadow under a star icon,
                     it helps if the contrasting area is obviously quite large.

                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Look at the size of the component, and imagine a box around it, how long is the longest
                        edge?
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>Look at the (contrasting) area of the focus indicator.</li>
                     
                     <li>Mentally compare the focus indicator to the length of the longest edge * 2px.</li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>If it is too close to call, you could extract the contrasting area of the focus indicator
                     and evaluate the surface area.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>If a focus indicator has a gradient, the principle is to measure the contrast of the
                     changed area, and ignore the change that does not me 3:1.

                     <figcaption>Figure 7When a gradient is used on a focus indictor, the measure of surface area should only

                  <p>If you take some spot-checks on the gradient area and establish what area meets the
                     contrast, it is straightforward to work out if that area is sufficient.
