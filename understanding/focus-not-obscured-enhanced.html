            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to ensure that a component with keyboard
               focus is visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="./focus-not-obscured.html">Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)</a> but requires that the whole of the component is visible.

               <li>This Success Criterion helps anyone who relies on the keyboard to operate the page
                  by letting them visually determine the component on which keyboard operations will
                  interact at any point in time.

               <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in
                  executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.
