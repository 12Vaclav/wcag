            <h1>About Understanding documents</h1>
            <p>Understanding WCAG 2.1 provides commentary on each guideline and each Success Criterion to help readers better understand the intent and how the guidelines and Success Criteria work together. The content of Understanding documents is not normative, which means it is not required for conformance.</p>
            <p>Understanding documents also provide examples of Techniques or combinations of Techniques that the Working Group has identified as being sufficient to meet each Success Criterion. Links are then provided to write-ups for each of the Techniques. </p>
