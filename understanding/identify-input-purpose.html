            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help people recognize and understand the purpose of form input fields. When people fill in a web form, they are usually expected to provide information about themselves in various fields. Examples are first name, family name, street adress, postal code, username, or credit card details. Specifying what kind of data is expected in a particular field makes filling out forms easier, especially for people with cognitive disabilities.</p>
            <p>While appropriate visible labels and instruction can help users understand the purpose of form input fields, users may benefit from having fields devoted to specific types of information be presented/displayed in an unambiguous, consistent, and possibly customizable way - either through defaults in their user agent, or through the aid of assistive technologies. To this end, form input fields require programmatically determinable information about their purpose.</p>
            <p>For some input fields, the type attribute already offers a way to specify the purpose, for example, input type="tel", input type="email", or input type="password". However, these are only very broad categories, describing the type of input, but not necessarily its purpose.</p>
            <p>Currently a well-supported way of identifying input purpose is using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#sec-autofill">autocomplete values from HTML5.2</a>. The HTML autocomplete attribute allows a more fine-grained identification of purpose than the type attribute, for example, by allowing the author to specify whether a password is a current password (autocomplete="current-password") or a newly selected password intended to replace the current password (autocomplete="new-password").@@need a different example other than password.</p>
            <p>For fields with autocomplete values set, the browser can suggest and 'autofill' the right content by autocompleting these fields based on past user input stored in the browser. The user is relieved of having to type the information, and can instead confirm or - if needed - change the value of the field.</p>
            <p>In addition to helping user agents provide the appropriate autofill behavior, the autocomplete values may also be used by assistive technologies to customise the presentation of input fields to users. For example, assisitive technologies may display familiar icons next to input fields to help users who have difficulties reading. An icon of a person may be shown in front of an input field with autocomplete="name", or the icon of a telephone in front of an input field with autocomplete="tel".</p>
            <p>When the user agent and assitive technology support for other metadata formats matures, metadata schemes like the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/personalization-semantics/content/">Personalization Semantics Content Module</a> may be used in addition or instead of the HTML autocomplete attribute to identify the purpose of input fields. These metadata need not be limited to input fields and can provide a richer context for interface personalization. They can also support automated adaptations that identify and match author-provided input labels to defined vocabularies or symbols that are used instead for labelling inputs.</p>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>People with language and memory related disabilities or disabilities that affects executive function and decision making
   benefit from the browser autofilling personal information (such as name or address), which means information does not need to be typed in via a keyboard.</li>
               <li>People with motor impairments also benefit from reducing the need for manual input when filling out forms.</li>
               <li>People with cerebral palsy, stroke, head injury, motor neurone disease or learning disability sometimes prefer images for communication. They can employ assistive technology which adds icons to input fields to communicate the purpose of the fields visually.</li>
               <li>Assistive technology can offer a customised way of identifying particular input fields, for example, draing on a set of symbols / icons that is familiar to the user.</li>

                  <br/>A contact form auto-fills in the fields for name, street, post code, city, telephone number and email address from autofill values stored in the user's browser.</li>

                  <strong>An order from with separate billing ans shipping address</strong>
                  <br/>An product order form fills in the address fields for billing address and a separate set of address fields for the shipping address, using the autofill detail tokens 'billing' and 'shipping'</li>

                  <strong>A contact form using icons</strong>
                  <br/>A browser plugin to add icons inserts icons representing the person's name, home address, telephone number and email address to  identify the input purpose visually.</li>
