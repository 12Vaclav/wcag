            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard-like device (e.g.,
               a switch, voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. When
               progressing through a page other content can hide the focused element.
            </p>
            <p>Where other content can overlap with a focused item, the focused element should not
               be hidden. Typical types of content that can overlap focused items are sticky footers,
               sticky headers, or non-modal dialogues. As a user tabs through the page, these layers
               of content can obscure the focused item, including the focus indicator. If the interface
               is configurable so that the user can move toolbars and non-modal dialogs around, then
               only the initial positions of user-movable content would be considered for testing
               and conformance of this success criterion.

               <li>This Success Criterion helps anyone who relies on the keyboard to operate the page
                  by letting them visually determine the component on which keyboard operations will
                  interact at any point in time.

               <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in
                  executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.
