            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure functionality that uses a dragging
               movement (e.g., sliders, drag-and-drop interfaces) has another <a href="#dfn-single-pointer">single pointer</a> mode of operation without the need for the dexterity required to drag elements.
            </p>
            <p>Some people cannot perform dragging movements in a precise manner.  Others use a specialized
               or adapted input device - such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled
               mouse emulator, which makes dragging cumbersome, error-prone, or outright impossible.
            </p>
            <p>When an interface implements functionality that uses dragging movements, users perform
               four discrete actions:
            </p>
            <ol>
               
               <li>tap or click to establish a starting point, then</li>
               
               <li>press and hold that contact while...</li>
               
               <li>performing a repositioning of the pointer, before...</li>
               
               <li>releasing the pointer at the end point.</li>
               
            </ol>
            <p>Not all users can accurately press and hold that contact while also repositioning
               the pointer. An alternative method must be provided so that users with mobility impairments
               who use a pointer (mouse, pen, or touch contact) can use the functionality.
            </p>

               <h3>Relationship to other requirements</h3>
               
               
               <p>Success Criteria 2.1.1 Keyboard and 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) require dragging
                  features to be keyboard accessible. However, achieving keyboard equivalence for a
                  dragging operation does not automatically meet this Success Criterion; it is possible
                  to create an interface that works with dragging and keyboard controls that does not
                  work using only clicks or taps. While many designs can be created for a dragging alternative
                  which address both keyboard accessibility and operability by single pointer operation,
                  the two requirements should be assessed independently.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>This Success Criterion applies to dragging movements as opposed to pointer gestures,
                  which are covered in <a href="pointer-gestures">Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures</a>. Pointer gestures include directional path-based as well as multi-point gestures.
                  In contrast, for dragging movements, only the start and end point of the movement
                  matters, not the actual path.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Additional examples are selection rectangles that set the first x/y rectangle coordinate
                  at the pointer position via a pointer down-event, and the second x/y coordinate, after
                  a dragging movement, at the next up-event. A similar example is a connecting line
                  drawn between two different items on the screen, as in an allocation test where users
                  are required to draw a line between questions and corresponding answers. In these
                  cases, the dragging movement requires an alternative way to accomplish the same action
                  that does not rely on the dragging movement. For example, two separate single tap
                  or click actions may define the rectangle coordinates or the start and end points
                  of a connecting line.
               </p>

               <h3>Alternatives for dragging movements on the same page</h3>
               
               
               <p>Where functionality can be executed via dragging movements and an equivalent option
                  exists that allows for single-pointer access without dragging, this Success Criterion
                  is passed. It does not have to be the same component, so long as the functionality
                  is equivalent. An example is a color wheel where a color can be changed by dragging
                  an indicator. In addition, text fields for the numerical input of color values allow
                  the definition of a color without requiring dragging movements. (Note that a text
                  input is considered device agnostic; although the purpose is to enter characters,
                  text entry can take place through voice, pointer or keyboard.)

               <h3>Distinguishing dragging movements from path-based pointer gestures</h3>
               
               
               <p>Dragging movements covered in this Success Criterion are pointer interactions where
                  only the start- and endpoints matter. Once the pointer engages with a target, the
                  direction of the dragging movement does not factor into the interaction until the
                  pointer disengages the target. Since the dragging movement does not have an intermediate
                  point, the dragging movement can go in any direction. Path-based gestures are covered
                  in Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures. For more details, refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html">Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures</a></p>
