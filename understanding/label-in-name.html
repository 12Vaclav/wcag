         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#label-in-name" style="font-weight: bold;">2.5.3 Label in Name</a> (Level A): For <a>user interface components</a> with <a>labels</a> that include <a>text</a> or <a>images of text</a>, the <a>name</a> contains the text that is presented visually.
         </p>
         <p>A best practice is to have  the text of the label at the start of the name.</p>

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion (SC) is to help ensure that people with disabilities
               who rely on visual labels can also use
               			those labels programmatically. Controls are often labeled with visible text. Controls
               also have a programmatic label, known
               			as its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/">Accessible Name</a>. Users have a much better experience if the visible text labels of controls match
               their accessible
               			names.
            </p>
            <p>Speech input users can navigate by speaking the visible text labels of menus, links
               and buttons that appear on the
               			screen. It’s confusing to speech input users when they say a visible text label
               they see, but the speech input does not work
               			because the accessible name that is enabled as a speech input command does not
               match the visible label.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, when the accessible name is different from the visible label, it essentially
               becomes an unknown hidden command
               			for speech input users that can be accidentally activated without the user knowing
               what has happened.
            </p>
            <p>Text-to-speech users will also have a better experience if the text they hear matches
               the text they see on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>This issue is even more important for speech input and text-to-speech users who also
               have cognitive challenges. It’s an extra
               			cognitive load for a speech input user to remember and say a speech command that
               is different from the visible label they see on a
               			control. It’s also an extra cognitive load for a text-to-speech user to absorb
               and understand speech output that does not
               			match the visible label.
