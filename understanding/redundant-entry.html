            <h2>Status</h2>
            
            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.
            </p>
            
         </section>
         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users can successfully navigate
               multi-step processes. It reduces cognitive effort where  information is asked for
               more than once during steps in a process. It also reduces the need to recall information
               provided in a previous  step.
            </p>
            <p>Information that is required to be remembered for input can pose a significant barrier
               to users with cognitive or memory difficulties. All users experience a natural gradual
               mental fatigue as they proceed through steps in a process. This fatigue is accelerated
               by the stress of recalling information from short-term working memory. Users with
               learning, and cognitive disabilities are highly susceptible to mental fatigue.
            </p>
            <p>Requiring people to recall information already entered in the previous steps can cause
               them to give up or enter incorrect information. The autocomplete feature of browsers
               is not considered sufficient because it is the content (the web site) that needs to
               provide the stored information for a redundant entry, or avoid asking for the same
               information again.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion does not add a requirement to remember information between
               sessions. A <a href="#dfn-process">process</a> is defined on the basis of an activity and is not applicable when a user returns
               after closing a session or navigating away. However, a process can run across different
               domains, so if a check-out process includes a 3rd party payment provider, that would
               be in scope.
            </p>
            <p>The term "available to select" is not prescriptive. The term allows authors to develop
               techniques where auto-population is not possible. It can include allowing the user
               to:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>select and populate a field, including from a drop-down;</li>
               
               <li>select text from the page and copy it into an input;</li>
               
               <li>tick a checkbox to populate inputs with the same values as previously entered (e.g.,
                  my billing address is the same as my shipping address).
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>This Success Criterion does not apply if data is provide by the user with a different
               method, such as uploading a resume in a document format.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion does not impact <a href="accessible-authentication.html">Accessible Authentication</a>, for which allowing auto-filling of passwords is a sufficient technique. In that
               case the filling is performed by the user's browser. Redundant Entry is asking for
               the website content to make the previous entry available, but not between sessions
               or for essential purposes such as asking for a password.
            </p>
            <p>There are exceptions for:</p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Essential uses of input re-entry for things like memory games which would be invalidated
                  if the previous answers were supplied.
               </li>
               
               <li>Security measures such as preventing a password string from being shown or copied.
                  When creating a password, it should be a unique and complex string and therefore cannot
                  be validated by the author. If the system requires the user to manually create a password
                  that is not displayed, having users re-validate their new string is allowed as an
                  exception.
               </li>
               
               <li>When the previously entered information is no longer valid, it can be requested that
                  the user enter that information again.
               </li>

               <li>Users with cognitive disabilities experience short-term, working memory difficulty.
                  Not having to repeatedly remember particular information reduces stress and the likelihood
                  of mistakes.

               <li>Users who experience difficulty forming new memories, recalling information, and other
                  functions related to cognition can complete processes without having to unnecessarily
                  rely on their memory.
               </li>
               
               <li>Users with mobility impairments, for example using switch control or voice input,
                  benefit from a reduced need for text entry.

                  of a process to purchase a new computer. In the 3rd step the user is asked to confirm
                  that the computer will belong to the user (rather than a colleague), and re-shows
                  the ID. It allows the user to change the ID, but defaults to the previously entered
                  one.
               </li>
               
               <li>A form on an e-commerce website allows the user to confirm that the billing address
                  and delivery address are the same address.
