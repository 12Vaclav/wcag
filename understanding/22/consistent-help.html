      <blockquote>
         <p class="conformance-level">A</p>

         <p>For each <a>web page</a> within a <a>set of web pages</a> that provides one or more of the following ways of finding help, access to at least one form of help is included in the same relative order on each page:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Human contact details;</li>
               <li>Human contact mechanism;</li>
               <li>Self-help option;</li>

            </ul>

        <h2>Intent of Consistent Help</h2>


        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make it easier for users to find available help for a Web site. This is distinct from interface-level help, such as contextual help, spell checkers, and instructional text in a form. </p>

        <p>At least one of the following ways to get help should be included on all websites:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Human contact details such as a phone number, email address, or hours of operation.</li>
           <li>A mechanism for human contact such as a messaging system, chat client, contact form, or social media channel.</li>
           <li>A self-help option such as an up-to-date Frequently Asked Questions or Support page.</li>
           <li>A fully automated contact mechanism such as a chatbot.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While it would be best for all sites to offer at least one of these types of help, this SC does not require help be provided. The SC requires that when help <em>is</em> available that it be in a consistent location.</p>

        <p>Locating the help mechanism in a consistent location across pages makes it easier for users to find it.  For example, when a mechanism or link is located in the header of one Web page, it will be easier to find if it is in the header of other pages.</p>
            
        <p>The location for help should remain consistent both visually and programmatically within a set of pages. However, the location can alter if the set of pages is transformed, say to a smaller viewport. The help may be positioned differently than in a larger viewport; however, it should then be consistent across all pages in the smaller viewport presentation.</p>

        <p>People with some types of disabilities may encounter more problems completing a task on a Web site. Issues could include difficulty completing a form, or finding a document or page which provides information required to complete a task. Without help, some users may abandon the task. They may also fail to correctly complete a task, or they may require assistance from people who do not necessarily keep private information secure.</p>

        <p>When a user is quickly able to find help, they are able to complete the task even if they encounter challenges.</p>

        <p>Users should not need to resort to internet searches to find the contact information for an organization. Further, users struggling to complete a task on a site shouldn't encounter additional cognitive challenges when searching for help <em>within</em> the site. The user’s disability may make it more difficult to find the help available if the information is not present within a few interactions.</p>
        <h3>Forms of help</h3>

        <h4>Human contact details</h4>
        <p>The human contact details should enable the user to connect with the  organization or the part of the organization that can assist with the relevant content. For example, an online jobs / recruitment portal should provide a contact method for the team that supports the recruitment portal and not a catch-all for the entire company. Each layer of contact added prolongs the time before the user will receive help.</p>
<h4>Mechanism for human contact</h4>
        <p>The mechanism for human contact enables a person to express what they are looking for using their own words. For some with cognitive disabilities, this may be the best way for them to find an answer to their problem.</p>
<h4>Self-help</h4>
        <p>For pages for which no human support is available, a self-help option should say that no human support is available.  Self-help options should go beyond allowing the user to search within the site. Contextual help is still recommended (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-context-help.html">3.3.5 Help</a> for more information), but a self-help option should provide a single location that makes it easier for people with cognitive disabilities to understand what help is available without having to hunt for it. While some people may easily be able to identify that no support would be available for a particular type of Web site, this may not be apparent to some users with disabilities.</p>
<h4>Automated</h4>
        <p>If a chatbot is provided, it should meet other WCAG Success Criteria for your conformance level. Chatbots which work more effectively for everyone, and particularly for people with cognitive disabilities should:</p>

			<ul>
            <li>recognize misspelled words;</li>
            <li>provide human contact details if the chatbot is unable to provide a satisfactory response after 3 attempts; and</li>
            <li>be dismissed with a single interaction, and recalled using a link or button.</li>
         </ul>

        <p>It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require authors to provide help information on PDFs or other static documents that may be available for viewing/download from the Web pages. It is also not the intent to require contact information if:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>a Web site is not supported;</li>
				<li>content is archived; or </li>
            <li>finding help would invalidate the activity, such as in a testing situation. </li>
         </ul>

        <p>It is also not the intent of this Success Criterion to require a human be available at all times. If the human contact is not available during certain hours or certain days, information should be provided so the user can tell when it will be available. </p>

      <h2>Benefits of Consistent Help</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>This Success Criterion helps people who may have difficulty locating help that is not part of the page they are using. Ensuring they can connect with help allows them to complete the task.</li>
         <li>When a user can easily find help for their specific questions, they are more successful completing tasks.</li>
         <li>Users that experience cognitive fatigue or cognitive shut down will be able to reserve their energy for the task, instead of using it to find support.</li>
         <li>Enabling users (especially those with cognitive disabilities) to find solutions while expressing their question using their own words increases their chances of success for completing a task.</li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Consistent Help</h2>

      <ul>
         <li><strong>On-line job application</strong><br />
            Some of the application questions may be hard for new job seekers to understand even after reading the contextual help. For example, the form may request their identification number, but they may have several and not know which one to enter. Easily findable contact information will enable them to use phone or email so they can get an answer to their question.</li>   
         <li><strong>appointment scheduling form</strong><br />
            When the service a patient is trying to book is not easily findable within the interface, they may need human help. A built-in messaging option (chat client) enables them to quickly interact with a staff person that can help, without requiring them to manage a second interface.</li>   
         <li><strong>Finding a specific policy or procedure</strong><br />
            An employee who needs to complete a work task may have difficulty locating the specific policy or procedure document on their employer’s Web site. A "How Do I" page may include the information that enables them to independently complete this task.</li>        
      </ul>
