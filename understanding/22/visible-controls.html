        <h2>Intent of Visible Controls</h2>

		<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that controls can be easily found by people with cognitive disabilities and by those with low vision, when they are needed.</p>

				<p>Some design approaches hide controls needed to complete tasks and require mouse-over to display these controls. These required interactions can leave users with cognitive disabilities without a path forward.</p>
      <h3>Cognitive disabilities</h3>
      <p>People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find controls if they are hidden until a pointer hovers over them. They may also not remember where the control is the next time they interact with the site. Additionally, some methods for exposing hidden controls (such as mouse-over) may not be supported by all platforms or user-agents.</p>
    
      <h3>Low vision</h3>
<p> People with low vision can also have trouble with hidden controls. For example,  a low vision user may have 800x600 resolution at the default browser zoom. 	The user looks closely at the monitor – say 4 inches from the display.  Due to the distance from the monitor, the acuity of the person and Scotomas (blind spots), the user is only able to clearly read  4 or 5 words on the screen in a small circle – but can see that there are objects, text, colors, and other items around on the page.   In fact there are hundreds of words or controls that appear – but are not legible. When a user can’t find what they are looking for the user may start moving their head around the screen looking for controls.   If that is not successful then using the mouse requires the user to jiggle the mouse and mouse his/her head around looking for the mouse pointer. Then hovering over objects one by one to find out what they do.  </p>
      <p>Using the keyboard means likely starting from the top of the page and tabbing through many times to find the content on the page – likely trying to visually track where the keyboard focus is on the page at each tab stop looking to see if something appears on focus.  Tracking the visual keyboard focus is very difficult as it jumps around, can be in different forms and go through many controls even when the page is WCAG conformant.  Moving around the screen with their head can cause neck pain.  Users with low vision are likely moving their physical head side to side up and down continually as they mouse over each and every control. For most low visipn users its not just moving the eyes, and in cases where the user doesn't have to move the head, trying to control eye gaze with nystagmus (involuntary, rapid and repetitive eye movement) is exhausting as well.
 
Thus,  one of the main challenges for low vision users is simply locating related controls on the screen, moving the mouse from control to control or getting the keyboard to the point where the user is looking.  It’s not uncommon for a low vision user to be looking where the mouse or keyboard is not located – for some users most of the time the mouse or keyboard is not where they are reading!   Some users in this situation are not using any magnification software but the text is large enough on the screen to read – but they can only read a few words clearly – they scroll through the screen with the mouse wheel.
 
Finding content by searching visually is very exhausting.  When a user doesn’t see something on the screen they assume it must be around but they are just missing it, it’s in their blind spot or it must be hidden in a menu, etc.  Then they have to go searching until they likely give up.
 
      <h3> Screen reader users</h3>
<p> Most screen readers today do not focus elements when the virtual/browser cursor reaches content.  Many screen reader users are not tabbing around the page.  This means for screen reader users unless there are clear roles or hidden instructions screen reader users may not be aware that they need to tab to focus an element.   Most advanced users are navigating by heading, paragraph, control, etc. which only moves the screen reader’s point of regard and not the system focus.
      <h3>Speech recognitipn users</h3>
<p>For speech recognition users, hovering the mouse would require using a mouse grid and use of the keyboard to focus content would require saying press tab to move from control to control, which is not common for users of speech recognition.  Most users are activating controls by speaking the name of the control or by roles such as click link, etc.  Trying to focus or hover just to find out if the control had something on focus/hover would be verbally exhausting.


		<h3>When Needed</h3>
		<p>Controls should be visible without user interaction (i.e., persistently visible) when they are needed. Controls do not need to be visible all the time. The can be available through a <b><i>visible entry point</i></b>, such as menu button which opens sub items. When multiple controls are included in a single location, some indication of those controls such as a drop down indicator should be visible without user interaction. Also they don't need to be visible if there is another control that achieves the same task and is visible. That would meet an exception. </p>
      
     <p> In multi-step processes or multipart forms, the control may be hidden in an earlier step/part, however, at the time the user can move forward the control needs to be persistently visible without having interacted with the control.  Similarly, this SC does not require inactive controls to be persistently visible until the user is able to progress. For example, when a form includes required fields be completed before the submit button becomes active, the submit button does not need to be persistently visible while it is inactive.</p> 

	

		<p>In some cases, controls are provided in multiple locations on a page or at multiple points within a process. In these cases, at least one of the instances of the controls needs to be visible without hover.  For example, in an email process, some controls such as trash may be visible using pointer hover in the list of emails but are always visible on the view of the email itself. Because the controls are persistently visible on the email view, they do not need to persistently visible on the list of emails.</p>

		<h3>Visible</h3>
		<p>The intent of this SC is to help individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities locate controls they need to successfully complete their desired task.  The controls addressed in this SC should also meet the SC for sufficient text (1.4.3/1.4.6) and non-text (1.4.11) contrast. </p>

		<h3>Embedded Controls</h3>
		<p>Components such as video players, web chats, and carousels often include controls that are only visible on hover since they overlay the contents being displayed.  The presence of the component (or the static placeholder picture for a video) is considered to be the "Information needed to identify user interface components", like the top visible part of a drop-down that shows sub-items. Some users may still struggle if media controls are not persistently visible, so there is benefit to providing a mechanism for people to keep the controls visible.</p>
      
      <h3>Applicable design principles from </h3>
<ul>
 <li> <b>Visibility</b>: The usability of a system is improved when its status and methods of use are clearly visible. Design systems that clearly indicate the system status, possible actions, and consequences of actions. Without visibility: “Whenever the number of possible actions exceeds the number of controls, there is apt to be difficulty.” (Donald Norman) The visible on pointer hover design pattern we are trying to address with this guidelines is one where actions provided through controls that are not persistently visible (i.e., that display on hover) and therefore, the possible actions are not visible.</li>
<li><b>Affordance/Conventions</b>: Affordance is a property in which the physical characteristics of an object or environment influence its function, like push plates on doors. With interfaces, affordances make possible actions visible by providing cues and hints, like buttons and underlined links. With the visible on pointer hover design pattern, possible actions are not made visible using affordances or conventions until they display on pointer hover. </li>
<li><b>Recognition Over Recall</b>: Memory for recognizing things is better than memory for recalling things. Minimize the need to recall information from memory whenever possible. With the visible on pointer hover design pattern, nothing is provided in the interface to help users recognize interactivity. To access functionality, users are relied on to recall that the controls display on hover.</li>
<li><b>Gulf of Execution</b>: “The gap between a user’s goal for action and the means to execute that goal.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_execution">Source</a> With our work to improve the accessibility of the visible on pointer hover design pattern, we aim to close the gap between the user’s goal to successfully access functionality and complete tasks and the need for clean designs. </li>
<li><b>Progressive Disclosure</b>: “A strategy for managing information complexity in which only necessary or requested information is displayed at any given time.” Progressive disclosure minimizes the complexity of an interface by providing access to primary controls and only revealing secondary controls when necessary or relevant (e.g., formatting controls that display when a text input area has focus, a dropdown menu control that displays secondary options when activated). With this SC, we aim to make sure the primary controls in this pattern are displayed without requiring pointer hover or keyboard focus.</li></ul>
      <h3>  Rationale based on functional needs </h3> 
     <p> This section shows the language of the  success criteria broken down, to illustrate how functional needs for different user groups are met by different requirements. </p>
