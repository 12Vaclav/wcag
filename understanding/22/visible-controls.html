      <h2>Intent of Visible Controls</h2>

      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user interface components (controls) can be found easily by people with cognitive disabilities, vision loss, and dexterity disabilities.</p>

      <p>Some design approaches hide controls and require certain user interactions (such as mouseover) to display them. Where the hidden controls are needed to complete tasks, the difficulty in discovering the controls can leave some users with disabilities without a path forward.</p>

      <h3>Cognitive disabilities</h3>

      <p>People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find hidden controls. If a hidden control is needed in order to progress, this can prevent some from completing a task. Users who _do_ discover that a control is displayed when they hovers over it, may not remember this the next time they interact with the site. So even where a user is able to proceed, time on task can be affected for both one-time and repeated uses.</p>
    
      <h3>Vision loss</h3>

      <p>People with vision loss may not see controls that display only on hover or focus, particularly if they display outside of the viewport. For users who require enlarged or magnified content, the portion of the content in the viewport may be signficantly reduced. A low vision user may have 800 x 600 resolution as the default browser zoom. A user may look closely at the monitor, say four inches from the display, due to limited acuity (inability to see detail) or Scotomas (blind spots). Thus, one of the main challenges for people with vision loss is simply locating related controls on the screen, moving the mouse from control to control, and getting the keyboard to the point where the user is looking. When a user doesn’t see something on the screen, they may assume they are missing it — for example, that it’s in their blind spot or hidden in a menu — and go searching until they either find it or give up searching. This success criterion can help reduce that cumulative load.</p>
 
      <h3>Users who limited or no use of their arms, who may be using speech recognition </h3>
<p>Most speech recognition users, who may not have use of their arms, are activating controls by speaking the name of the control. Functions that are only exposed by hovering over or putting keyboard focus on a control pose significant barriers to speech recognition interaction.


      <h3>When Needed</h3>
      
      <p> Controls do not need to be visible all the time. But controls must be visible <i>when they are needed</i>, without hover interaction or keyboard focus. They can be available through a persistent <b><i>visible entry point</i></b>, such as a menu button which opens sub items. In multi-step processes or multipart forms, the control may be hidden in an earlier step/part; however, at the time the user can move the process forward, the control needs to be visible without hover interaction.</p>

		<p>In some cases, controls are provided in multiple locations on a page or at multiple points within a process. In these cases, at least one of the instances of the controls needs to be visible without hover or keyboard focus.  For example, in an email process, some controls such as trash may be visible using pointer hover in the inbox list view, but are always visible on the view of the email itself. Because the controls are persistently visible on the email view, they do not need to be persistently visible on the inbox view.</p>

		<h3>Embedded Controls</h3>
		<p>Complex components such as video players and carousels often include controls that are visible on hover. If properly designed, the presence of the complex component (or the placeholder picture for a video) is considered to be the 'Information needed to identify the user interface components'. These components, when activated, should provide the same controls to the user that were shown on hover. For a carousel, the controls displayed on hover should also be displayed when the carousel is activated.  When the placeholder for a video is clicked it should launch the video (sometimes in a new window). At that point, more controls for the video, including the controls displayed previously on hover, should be visible. Some users may still struggle if media controls are not persistently visible, so there is benefit to providing a mechanism that allows users to have the controls persistently visible.</p>
