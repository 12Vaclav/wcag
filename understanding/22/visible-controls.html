        <h2>Intent of Visible Controls</h2>

		<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that controls can be found easily by people with cognitive disabilities, vision loss, and dexterity disabilities.</p>

	<p>Some design approaches hide controls, requiring certain user interactions, such as mouse-over, to display these controls. Where the hidden controls must be found in order to complete tasks, such interactions can leave some users with disabilities without a path forward.</p>
      <h3>Cognitive disabilities</h3>
      <p>People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find controls needed to progress if they are hidden until focus is placed on them or a pointer hovers over them. They may also not remember where the control is the next time they interact with the site. People with limited vision may not see controls that display on focus or hover, particularly if they display outside of the viewport. People with motor and mobility impairments who use speech for input may encounter difficulties finding and activating controls that display only on focus or hover. Additionally, some methods for exposing hidden controls (such as mouse-over) may not be supported by all platforms or user-agents.</p>
    
      <h3>Low vision</h3>
<p> People with low vision can also have trouble with hidden controls. They need to be able to see or be aware of the affordances, so they recognize a control. A low vision user may have 800x600 resolution at the default browser zoom. 	The user looks closely at the monitor, say 4 inches from the display.  Due to the distance from the monitor, the acuity of the person (inability to see detail), and Scotomas (blind spots), the user is only able to clearly read  4 or 5 words on the screen in a small circle – but can see that there are objects, text, colors, and other items around on the page.  When a user can’t find what they are looking for the user may start moving their head around the screen looking for controls and/or jiggle the mouse around looking for the mouse pointer. Then hovering over objects one by one to find out what they do.  
      
 In cases where the user doesn't have to move the head, trying to control eye gaze with nystagmus (involuntary, rapid and repetitive eye movement) is exhausting as well.</p>
 <p>
Thus,  one of the main challenges for low vision users is simply locating related controls on the screen, moving the mouse from control to control or getting the keyboard to the point where the user is looking.  It’s not uncommon for a low vision user to be looking where the mouse or keyboard is not located.   Some users in this situation are not using any magnification software because the text is large enough on the screen to read, but they can only read a few words clearly, they scroll through the screen with the mouse wheel.</p>
 
Thus finding content by searching visually can be very exhausting.  When a user doesn’t see something on the screen they assume it must be around but they are just missing it, it’s in their blind spot or it must be hidden in a menu, etc.  Then they have to go searching until they likely give up. This success criterion can help reduce that cumulative load.</p>
 
      <h3>Users who are blind (Screen reader users)</h3>
<p> Most screen readers today do not place focus on elements when the virtual/browser cursor reaches content.  Many screen reader users are not tabbing around the page.  This means for screen reader users unless there are clear roles or hidden instructions screen reader users may not be aware that they need to tab to focus an element.   Most advanced users are navigating by heading, paragraph, control, etc. which only moves the screen reader’s point of regard and not the system focus.
      <h3>Users who do not have use of their arms, who may be using speech recognition </h3>
<p>For speech recognition users, who may not have use of their arms, hovering the mouse would require using a mouse grid and use of the keyboard to focus content would require saying press tab to move from control to control, which is not common for users of speech recognition.  Most users are activating controls by speaking the name of the control or by roles such as click link, etc.  Trying to focus or hover just to find out if the control had something on focus/hover would be verbally exhausting.


		<h3>When Needed</h3>
		<p>Controls should be visible without user interaction (i.e., persistently visible) when they are needed. Controls do not need to be visible all the time. The can be available through a <b><i>visible entry point</i></b>, such as a menu button which opens sub items.In multi-step processes or multipart forms, the control may be hidden in an earlier step/part, however, at the time the user can move forward the control needs to be persistently visible without having interacted with the control.  Similarly, this SC does not require inactive controls to be persistently visible until the user is able to progress. For example, when a form includes required fields be completed before the submit button becomes active, the submit button does not need to be persistently visible while it is inactive. This Success criterion doesn't require user interface components to be visible if there is another component that achieves the same task and is visible. That would meet an exception. </p>
      
     <p> In multi-step processes or multipart forms, the control may be hidden in an earlier step/part, however, at the time the user can move forward the control needs to be persistently visible without having to hover over  the control.  Similarly, this SC does not require inactive controls to be persistently visible until the user is able to progress. For example, when a form includes required fields that need to be completed before the submit button becomes active, the submit button does not need to be persistently visible while it is inactive.</p> 

	<p>When multiple controls are included in a single location, some indication of those controls such as a drop down indicator should be visible without user interaction. </p>

		<p>In some cases, controls are provided in multiple locations on a page or at multiple points within a process. In these cases, at least one of the instances of the controls needs to be visible without hover.  For example, in an email process, some controls such as trash may be visible using pointer hover in the list of emails but are always visible on the view of the email itself. Because the controls are persistently visible on the email view, they do not need to be persistently visible on the list of emails.</p>

		<h3>Visible</h3>
	<p>The intent of this SC is to help individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities, people with low vision, and people with motor and mobility impairments locate and operate controls they need to successfully complete their desired task.  The controls addressed in this SC should also meet the SC for sufficient text (1.4.3/1.4.6) and non-text (1.4.11) contrast. </p>

		<h3>Embedded Controls</h3>
		<p>Components such as video players, web chats, and carousels often include controls that are only visible on hover since they overlay the contents being displayed.  The presence of the component (or the static placeholder picture for a video) is considered to be the "Information needed to identify user interface components", like the top visible part of a drop-down that shows sub-items. Some users may still struggle if media controls are not persistently visible, so there is benefit to providing a mechanism that allows users to have the controls persistently visible.</p>
