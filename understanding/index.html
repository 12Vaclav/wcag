         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         			
         <p>Understanding WCAG 2.1 is a  guide to understanding and using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1</a> [[WCAG21]] Although the normative definition and requirements for WCAG 2.1 can all
            be found in the WCAG 2.1 document itself, the concepts and provisions may be new to
            some people. Understanding WCAG 2.1 provides a non-normative extended commentary on
            each guideline and each Success Criterion to help readers better understand the intent
            and how the guidelines and Success Criteria work together. It also provides examples
            of techniques or combinations of techniques that the Working Group has identified
            as being sufficient to meet each Success Criterion. Links are then provided to write-ups
            for each of the techniques.

            <h3>Relationship to Understanding WCAG 2.0</h3>
            				
            <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding WCAG 2.0</a> [[UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20]] is a substantial resource to support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[WCAG20]]. Understanding WCAG 2.1 is a parallel resource that supports the new success
               criteria in WCAG 2.1. At this stage, it only includes content related to new features
               of WCAG 2.0. Future versions <em>may</em> include content relevant to WCAG 2.0, depending on how WCAG 2.1 evolves and what
               structure is determined to provide optimal support.
            </p>
            				
            <p>Unlike Understanding WCAG 2.0, this document has not been published as a Technical
               Report. This change reduces the formality of the document and increases the ability
               of the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group to maintain the content and optimize
               the structure. The Working Group considers the content to be authoritative. If feedback
               indicates the need, the document could be published as a Technical Report in the future.

            <h3>Structure of Understanding WCAG 2.1</h3>
            				
            <p>This is not an introductory document. It is a detailed technical description of the
               guidelines and their Success Criteria. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a> for an introduction to WCAG, supporting technical documents, and educational material.
               
            </p>
            				
            <p>Understanding WCAG 2.1 is organized by guideline. There is an <em>Understanding Guideline X.X</em> section for each guideline. The intent and any advisory techniques that are related
               to the guideline but not specifically related to any of its Success Criteria are listed
               there as well.
            </p>
            				
            <p>The <em>Understanding Guidelines X.X</em> section is then followed by a <em>Understanding Success Criterion X.X.X</em> section for each Success Criterion of that guideline. These sections each contain:
            </p>
            				
            <ul>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p>The Success Criterion as it appears in WCAG 2.1</p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p>Intent of the Success Criterion</p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p>Benefits (how the Success Criterion helps people with disabilities)</p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p>Examples</p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p> Related Resources </p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p>Techniques or combinations of techniques that are sufficient to meet the guidelines</p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p>Failures of this Success Criterion</p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p>Additional advisory techniques that go beyond what is required to meet the Success
                     Criterion but can be used to make some or all types of content more accessible. Use
                     of advisory techniques does not impact the level of conformance claimed. 
                  </p>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>
                  						
                  <p>Key terms for this Success Criterion (taken from the WCAG 2.1 Glossary)</p>
                  					
               </li>
               				
            </ul>
            				
            <p>Links are provided from each Guideline in WCAG 2.1 directly to each <em>Understanding Guideline X.X</em> in this document. Similarly, there is a link from each Success Criterion in WCAG
               2.1 to the <em>Understanding Success Criterion X.X.X</em> section in this document.

            <h3>Techniques for WCAG 2.1</h3>
            				
            <p>Techniques specific to WCAG 2.1 are expected to come available soon. In the meantime,
               Understanding pages reference existing techniques from WCAG 2.0 where applicable,
               and suggests titles for new techniques that are proposed for WCAG 2.1.

   dfn-abbreviation
   abbreviation
   abbreviations
   
   
   shortened form of a word, phrase, or name where the abbreviation has not become part
   of the language
   
   
   This includes initialisms and acronyms where:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   initialisms are shortened forms of a name or phrase made from the initial letters of words or
   syllables contained in that name or phrase
   
   
   Not defined in all languages.
   
   SNCF is a French initialism that contains the initial letters of the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer, the French national railroad.
   
   
   ESP is an initialism for extrasensory perception.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   acronyms are abbreviated forms made from the initial letters or parts of other words (in a
   name or phrase) which may be pronounced as a word
   
   
   NOAA is an acronym made from the initial letters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration in the United States.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Some companies have adopted what used to be an initialism as their company name. In
   these cases, the new name of the company is the letters (for example, Ecma) and the
   word is no longer considered an abbreviation.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-accessibility-supported
   accessibility supported
   accessibility-supported
   accessibility support
   
   
   supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents
   
   
   To qualify as an accessibility-supported use of a Web content technology (or feature
   of a technology), both 1 and 2 must be satisfied for a Web content technology (or
   feature):
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The way that the Web content technology is used must be supported by users' assistive technology (AT).  This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability
   with users' assistive technology in the human language(s) of the content,
   
   
   
   AND
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The Web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are
   available to users.  This means that at least one of the following four statements is true:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The technology is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents that are also
   accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS);
   
   
   
   OR
   
   
   
   
   The technology is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in that is also accessibility
   supported;
   
   
   
   OR
   
   
   
   
   The content is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate
   network, where the user agent required by the technology and used by the organization
   is also accessibility supported;
   
   
   
   OR
   
   
   
   
   The user agent(s) that support the technology are accessibility supported and are
   available for download or purchase in a way that:
   
   
   
   
   does not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability
   and
   
   
   is as easy to find and obtain for a person with a disability as it is for a person
   without disabilities.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The WCAG Working group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive
   technologies there must be for a particular use of a Web technology in order for it
   to be classified as accessibility supported. (See Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support".)
   
   
   Web technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long
   as they are not relied upon and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including Conformance Criterion 4 and Conformance Criterion 5, are met.
   
   
   When a Web Technology is used in a way that is "accessibility supported," it does not imply that the entire
   technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including
   HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if
   the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to
   meet WCAG requirements.
   
   
   When citing Web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported
   should be specified.
   
   
   One way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported
   would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported.
   (See Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses.) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported
   ways of using Web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in
   the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web
   content technologies above.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-alternative-for-time-based-media
   alternative for time-based media
   
   
   document including correctly sequenced text descriptions of time-based visual and
   auditory information and providing a means for achieving the outcomes of any time-based
   interaction
   
   
   A screenplay used to create the synchronized media content would meet this definition
   only if it was corrected to accurately represent the final synchronized media after
   editing.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-ambiguous-to-users-in-general
   ambiguous to users in general
   
   
   the purpose cannot be determined from the link and all information of the Web page
   presented to the user simultaneously with the link (i.e., readers without disabilities
   would not know what a link would do until they activated it)
   
   
   The word guava in the following sentence "One of the notable exports is guava" is
   a link. The link could lead to a definition of guava, a chart listing the quantity
   of guava exported or a photograph of people harvesting guava. Until the link is activated,
   all readers are unsure and the person with a disability is not at any disadvantage.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-ascii-art
   ascii art
   
   
   picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the
   95 printable characters defined by ASCII)
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-assistive-technology
   assistive technology
   assistive technologies
   
   
   hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements
   of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents
   
   
   functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations
   (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g.,
   voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations
   (e.g., to make tables more accessible).
   
   
   Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents
   by using and monitoring APIs.
   
   
   The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
   Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
   The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
   that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
   target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
   provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
   of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
   to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
   markup into identifiable bundles.
   
   
   Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include
   the following:
   
   
   
   
   screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with
   visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing,
   color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability
   of rendered text and images;
   
   
   screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information
   through synthesized speech or braille;
   
   
   text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and
   learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
   
   
   speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;
   
   alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities
   to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single
   switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);
   
   
   alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities
   to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-audio
   audio
   
   
   the technology of sound reproduction
   
   Audio can be created synthetically (including speech synthesis), recorded from real
   world sounds, or both.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-audio-description
   audio description
   audio descriptions
   
   
   narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot
   be understood from the main soundtrack alone
   
   
   Audio description of video provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and
   other visual content.
   
   
   In standard audio description, narration is added during existing pauses in dialogue.
   (See also extended audio description.)
   
   
   Where all of the video information is already provided in existing audio, no additional audio description is necessary.
   
   
   Also called "video description" and "descriptive narration."
   
   
   
   
   dfn-audio-only
   audio-only
   
   
   a time-based presentation that contains only audio (no video and no interaction)
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-blinking
   blinking
   
   
   switch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention
   
   See also flash. It is possible for something to be large enough and blink brightly enough at the
   right frequency to be also classified as a flash.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-blocks-of-text
   blocks of text
   
   
   more than one sentence of text
   
   
   
   
   dfn-captcha
   captcha
   
   
   initialism for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans
   Apart"
   
   
   CAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an
   obscured image or audio file.
   
   
   A Turing test is any system of tests designed to differentiate a human from a computer.
   It is named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing. The term was coined by researchers
   at Carnegie Mellon University.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-captions
   captions
   
   
   synchronized visual and/or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content
   
   
   Captions are similar to dialogue-only subtitles except captions convey not only the
   content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information
   needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter,
   speaker identification and location.
   
   
   Closed Captions are equivalents that can be turned on and off with some players.
   
   Open Captions are any captions that cannot be turned off. For example, if the captions
   are visual equivalent images of text embedded in video.
   
   
   Captions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.
   
   In some countries, captions are called subtitles.
   
   
   Audio descriptions can be, but do not need to be, captioned since they are descriptions of information
   that is already presented visually.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-changes-of-context
   changes of context
   change of context
   
   
   major changes in the content of the Web page that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view
   the entire page simultaneously
   
   
   Changes in context include changes of:
   
   
   
   
   user agent;
   
   
   
   viewport;
   
   
   focus;
   
   
   content that changes the meaning of the Web page
   
   
   
   
   A change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as
   an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the
   context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).
   
   
   Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including
   anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly
   re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-conformance
   conformance
   conform
   
   
   satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification
   
   
   
   
   dfn-conforming-alternate-version
   conforming alternate version
   
   
   version that
   
   
   
   conforms at the designated level, and
   
   provides all of the same information and functionality in the same human language, and
   
   
   is as up to date as the non-conforming content, and
   
   
   for which at least one of the following is true:
   
   
   
   the conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an accessibility-supported
   mechanism, or
   
   
   the non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version, or
   
   the non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides
   a mechanism to reach the conforming version
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   In this definition, "can only be reached" means that there is some mechanism, such
   as a conditional redirect, that prevents a user from "reaching" (loading) the non-conforming
   page unless the user had just come from the conforming version.
   
   
   The alternate version does not need to be matched page for page with the original
   (e.g., the conforming alternate version may consist of multiple pages).
   
   
   If multiple language versions are available, then conforming alternate versions are
   required for each language offered.
   
   
   Alternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments
   or user groups. Each version should be as conformant as possible. One version would
   need to be fully conformant in order to meet conformance requirement 1.
   
   
   The conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance,
   or even on the same Web site, as long as it is as freely available as the non-conforming
   version.
   
   
   Alternate versions should not be confused with supplementary content, which support the original page and enhance comprehension.
   
   
   Setting user preferences within the content to produce a conforming version is an
   acceptable mechanism for reaching another version as long as the method used to set
   the preferences is accessibility supported.

   dfn-contrast-ratio
   contrast ratio
   
   
   (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where
   
   
   
   L1 is the relative luminance of the lighter of the colors, and
   
   
   L2 is the relative luminance of the darker of the colors.
   
   
   
   
   Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).
   
   Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered
   (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be
   evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.
   
   
   For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect
   to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no
   background color is specified, then white is assumed.
   
   
   Background color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered
   in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text
   color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot
   be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text
   color is specified when a background color is specified.
   
   
   When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be
   used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border
   around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that
   fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.
   
   
   WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that
   an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not
   consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except
   where caused by authors' code.

   A CSS pixel is the canonical unit of measure for all lengths and measurements in CSS.
   This unit is density-independent, and distinct from actual hardware pixels present
   in a display. User agents and operating systems should ensure that a CSS pixel is
   set as closely as possible to the CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 reference pixel [[!css3-values]], which takes into account the physical dimensions of the display
   and the assumed viewing distance (factors that cannot be determined by content authors).

   dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds
   general flash and red flash thresholds
   
   
   a flash or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content passes) if any of the following are true:
   
   
   
   
   there are no more than three general flashes and / or no more than three red flashes within any one-second period; or
   
   
   the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total
   of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10
   degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance
   
   
   
   
   where:
   
   
   
   A general flash is defined as a pair of opposing changes in relative luminance of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance where the relative luminance of
   the darker image is below 0.80; and where "a pair of opposing changes" is an increase
   followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and
   
   
   A red flash is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red
   
   
   
   
   
   Exception: Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating
   checkerboard pattern with "squares" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical
   viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.
   
   
   For general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on
   the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide
   a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing
   distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). (Higher resolutions displays
   showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is
   lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.)
   
   
   A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for
   red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or
   relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists
   of two opposing transitions.
   
   
   The current working definition in the field for "pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red" is where, for either or both states involved in each transition, R/(R+ G + B) &gt;=
   0.8, and the change in the value of (R-G-B)x320 is &gt; 20 (negative values of (R-G-B)x320
   are set to zero) for both transitions. R, G, B values range from 0-1 as specified
   in “relative luminance” definition. [[HARDING-BINNIE]]
   
   
   Tools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However,
   no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal
   to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above).

   dfn-keyboard-interface
   keyboard interface
   
   
   interface used by software to obtain keystroke input
   
   
   A keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the
   native technology does not contain a keyboard.
   
   A touchscreen PDA has a keyboard interface built into its operating system as well
   as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface
   to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications
   that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text
   applications with "keyboard emulation" functionality.
   
   
   Operation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated
   mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard
   interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface,
   not through its keyboard interface.

   A label is presented to all users whereas the name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases
   the name and the label are the same.
   
   
   The term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.
   
   
   
   
   dfn-large-scale
   large scale
   large-scale
   
   
   with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size
   for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts
   
   
   Fonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that
   reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower
   contrast levels.
   
   
   Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing
   that may be done by a user.
   
   
   The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined
   size and the user's display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text
   fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150%
   of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors
   would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in
   relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display.
   The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font
   metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who
   have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.
   
   
   When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major
   browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If
   a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would
   be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from
   the default sizes in a similar fashion.
   
   
   The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large
   print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK
   languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those
   languages and the next larger standard large print size.

   and RsRGB, GsRGB, and BsRGB are defined as:
   
   
   
   RsRGB = R8bit/255
   
   GsRGB = G8bit/255
   
   BsRGB = B8bit/255
   
   
   
   The "^" character is the exponentiation operator. (Formula taken from [[sRGB]] and
   [[IEC-4WD]]).
   
   
   
   
   Almost all systems used today to view Web content assume sRGB encoding. Unless it
   is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content,
   authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3.
   
   
   If dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors
   that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered
   should be used (average R, average G, and average B).
   
   
   Tools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing contrast and
   flash.

   a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the
   full set of pages.
   
   
   Different language versions would be considered different sets of Web pages.

   	       Style properties can have several origins:
   
   User agent default styles: The default style property values applied in the absence
   of any author or user styles. Some web content technologies specify a default rendering,
   others do not;
   Author styles: Style property values that are set by the author as part of the content
   (e.g. in-line styles, author style
   sheets);
   User styles: Style property values that are set by the user (e.g. via user agent interface

   web technology
   web content technology
   web content technologies
   
   
   
   mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents
   
   
   As used in these guidelines "Web Technology" and the word "technology" (when used
   alone) both refer to Web Content Technologies.
   
   
   Web content technologies may include markup languages, data formats, or programming
   languages that authors may use alone or in combination to create end-user experiences
   that range from static Web pages to synchronized media presentations to dynamic Web
   applications.

   words used in such a way that requires users to know exactly which definition to apply
   in order to understand the content correctly
   
   
   The term "gig" means something different if it occurs in a discussion of music concerts
   than it does in article about computer hard drive space, but the appropriate definition
   can be determined from context. By contrast, the word "text" is used in a very specific
   way in WCAG 2.1, so a definition is supplied in the glossary.
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-user-agent
   user agent
   user agents

   a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct
   function
   
   
   Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element.
   Components here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user
   perceives as separate controls.
   
   
   User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated
   by scripts.
   
   
   What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes
   called "user interface element".
   
   
   An applet has a "control" that can be used to move through content by line or page
   or random access. Since each of these would need to have a name and be settable independently,
   they would each be a "user interface component."

   The user agent presents content through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames,
   loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport
   (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts,
   menus, and alerts are not viewports.
   
   
   This definition is based on User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Glossary [[UAAG10]].
   
   
   
   
   
   dfn-visually-customized
   visually customized
   
   
   the font, size, color, and background can be set

   a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources
   that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent
   
   
   Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource,
   they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.
   
   
   For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded"
   within the scope of conformance to be considered a Web page.
   
   
   A Web resource including all embedded images and media.
   
   A Web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program
   lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area
   and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar
   to display, but do not change the URI of the page as a whole.
   
   
   A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of
   different content modules.
   
   
   When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like
   interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging
   products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of
   you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet
   floating alongside. This might be a single-page Web site or just one page within a
   Web site.
