            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to allow people using assistive technology
               to find references to content based on the <a href="#dfn-page-break-locators">page break locators</a> found in the default view or printed version of a publication.
            </p>
            <p>Page numbering has long been a fundamental way to identify and communicate the location
               of written content. Page numbers are used constantly in references, footnotes, endnotes,
               and bibliographies. Particularly, they are critical in academic and learning environments.
            </p>
            <p>Digital publishing has provided valuable access to content for people who are blind,
               have low vision, dyslexia or other cognitive disabilities. In order to consume the
               information the content may be adapted to use a different  layout, or presented to
               them using assistive technology.  If there is no clear way to find a specific page
               from the print version that was referenced by a professor in class, because the electronic
               version is zoomed-in and that paragraph is on page 145 of the user's version of the
               content, the user misses out on valuable and sometimes critical information to understanding
               the reference.
            </p>
            <p>The scope of this criterion is web content which is part of a <a href="#dfn-web-page">Web page</a>. EPUB can fulfill this definition if it is available to read at a URI. The more common
               case that is in scope is an EPUB book converted to be read by a web browser.
            </p>
            <p>In publishing, there can be many different editions of a work, e.g. a second edition
               or a paperback edition. There is a requirement (separate from accessibility) for metadata
               in  digital publications like EPUB to identify the edition of the title of which this
               digital version represents. The page break locaters would be aligned with the specified
               edition.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
               <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
               <p>Statically paginated formats (e.g., PDF) where the user agents include a mechanism
                  to navigate by page typically meet this success criteria by default. The user agents
                  for the EPUB format also typically provide the navigation mechanism if a page list
                  is included. Web browsers do not have a standard page navigation mechanism, so for
                  HTML content with page break locators it is the author responsibility to add that
                  mechanism.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>For a Page Break Locator to be a "programmatically determinable destination marker",
               it needs to have a role that identifies it as a page break, and a method of determining
               which page in a sequence it represents. This would not apply to an element which visually
               shows a page number, unless it also has a recognized role. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/techniques/html/H99">H99: Provide page list navigation</a> provides an example of a page break locator.

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
