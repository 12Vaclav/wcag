            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this success criterion is to help users who may have trouble activating
               a small target because of hand tremors, limited dexterity or other reasons. If the
               target is too small, it may be difficult to aim at the target. Mice and similar pointing
               devices can be hard to use for these users, and a larger target will help them greatly
               in having positive outcomes on the web page.
            </p>
            <p>Touch is particularly problematic as it is an input mechanism with coarse precision.
               Users lack the same level of fine control as on inputs such as a mouse or stylus.
               A finger is larger than a mouse pointer, and generally obstructs the user's view of
               the precise location on the screen that is being touched/activated.
            </p>
            <p>The issue can be further complicated on for responsive/mobile which need to accommodate
               different types of fine and coarse inputs (e.g. a site that can be accessed both on
               a traditional desktop/laptop with a mouse, as well as on a tablet or mobile phone
               with a touch screen).
            </p>
            <p>While this criterion defines a minimum target size, it is recommended that larger
               sizes are used to reduce the possibility of unintentional actions. This is particularly
               relevant if any of the following are true:
            </p>
            <ul>
               			  
               <li>the control is used frequently;</li>
               			  
               <li>the result of the interaction cannot be easily undone;</li>
               			  
               <li>the control is positioned where it will be difficult to reach, or is near the edge
                  of the screen;
               </li>
               			  
               <li>the control is part of a sequential task.</li>
