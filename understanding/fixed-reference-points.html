            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to allow users with disabilities to find
               references to content based on the page locators found in the default view or printed
               version of a publication.
            </p>
            <p>The term “on the same page” is common in English to describe when two people are talking
               about the same thing and agree on the content of the conversation. This success criterion
               makes sure that all users can literally be on the same page.
            </p>
            <p>Page numbering has long been a fundamental way to identify and communicate the location
               of written content. They are used constantly in references, footnotes, endnotes, and
               bibliographies. Particularly, they are critical in academic and learning environments.
            </p>
            <p>Electronic publishing has provided valuable access to content for people who are blind,
               have low vision, dyslexia or other cognitive disabilities. In order to consume the
               information the content may be adapted to use a different  layout, or presented to
               them using assistive technology.  If there is no clear way to find a specific page
               from the print version that was referenced by a professor in class, because the electronic
               version is zoomed-in and that paragraph is on page 145 of the user’s version of the
               content, the user misses out on valuable and sometimes critical information to understanding
               the reference.

                     <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
