		<h1>Understanding Graphics Contrast</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>

			<p> If a graphic is needed to understand the content or functionality of the webpage then it should be perceivable by people with low vision or other impairments. Low contrast graphics are more difficult to percieve, and may be completely missed by people with a visual impairment.</p>
				
			<p>This success criteria was added to WCAG 2.1 so that contrast requirements for text in WCAG 2.0's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a> are applied to key graphics as well.</p>
			
			<h3>Required for understanding</h3>

			<p>The term &quot;required for understanding&quot; is used in the success criterai as many graphics do not need to meet the contrast requirements. If a person needs to perceive a graphic, or part of a graphic (a graphical object) in order to understand the content it should have sufficient contrast. That is not a requirement for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> A graphic with text embedded or overlayed that conveys the same information, such as labels and values on charts.</li>
				<li> The graphic is for aesthetic purposes that does not require the user to see or understand it to understand the content or use the functionality.</li>
				<li> The information is available in another form elsewhere on the page, or linked from the page.</li>
				<li> The graphic is part of a logo or brand name.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Graphical Objects</h3>

			<p>The term &quot;graphical object&quot; applies to stand-alone icons such as a print icon (with no text), and the important parts of a more complex diagram such as each line in a graph. For simple graphics such as single-colour icons the entire image is a graphical object. For images made up of multiple lines, colours and shapes they will be made of multiple graphical objects, some of which are required for understanding.</p>

			<p>Not every graphical object needs to contrast with its surroundings, only those that are required to understand what the graphic is conveying. You can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Pr.C3.A4gnanz">Gestalt principles</a> such as the &quot;law of continuity&quot; to ignore minor overlaps with other graphics or colors.</p>

						<th>Icon</th>

						<td><img src="" alt="" />
						(Magnet)</td>
						<td><p>A magnet can be understood by the U shape, with lighter coloured tips. Therefore to understand this graphic you should be able to discern the overall shape (against the background) and the lighter coloured tips (against the rest of the U shape and the background).</p>
						<p>The graphical objects are the U shape, and each tip of the magnet.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><img src="" alt="" />(Currency going down)</td>
						<td><p>The low-currency symbol can be understood with recognition of the shape (down arrow) and the currency symbol (pound icon with the shape). To understand this graphic you need to discern the arrow shape against the white background, and the pound icon against the yellow background.</p>
						<p>The graphical objects are the shape and the currency symbol.</p>

						<td><p>In order to understand the graph you need to discern the lines and shapes for each condition. Therefore each line and coloured shape is a ‘graphical object’ in the graph (which is over 3px in the original page) and should be over 3:1 against the white background. Most of them have good contrast except the green triangles. Notably the purple crosses are not 3px thick, but the contrast is 5:1 and the main line width is 3px wide.</p>
						<p>The graphical objects are the lines in the graph, including the background lines for the values, and the coloured lines with shapes.</p></td>

			<h3>Contrast for thicker graphics</h3>

			<!-- remove if we only use 3:1 -->
			<p> Graphics that are very thin are harder to perceive, therefore have a higher contrast requirement of 4.5:1. Graphics that are thicker or are solid shapes have a lower requirement of 3:1. </p>
			
			<p>For designers developing icons that need to be perceived clearly, see the following example:</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="img/stroke-comparisons.png" alt="stroke comparisons" />
				<figcaption>
					<p>Example of several sizes of icon having sufficient contrast at different sizes. </p>
					<p>The thicker lines (3px or more) have 3:1 contrast (#949494 on #FFFFFF), the small lines (2px or less) need a darker grey (#767676 on #FFFFFF).</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<!-- /end remove -->

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p>People with low vision often have difficulty perceiving graphics that have insufficient contrast. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#relativeluminancedef">relative luminance</a> (lightness) difference of 4.5:1 or greater can make these items more distinguishable when the person does not see a full range of colors. </p>

		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Status icons on an application's dashboard (without associated text) have a 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio.</li>
				<li>A graph uses a light background and ensures that the colours for each line have a 4.5:1 contrast ratio against the background.</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>Pie Charts</h3>
				<p>Pie charts make a good case study for this success criteria, the following pie charts are intended to convey the proportion of market share each browser has. NB: The actual figures are made up, these are not actual market shares. </p>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/graphics-contrast_pie-chart_fail.png" alt="Failing pie chart" />
					<figcaption>
						<p><strong>Fail:</strong> The following pie chart has labels for each slice (so passes 1.4.1 Use of Color), but in order to understand the proportions of the slices you must discern the edges of the slices (the graphical objects conveying essential information), and the contrast between the slices is not over 3:1. </p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/graphics-contrast_pie-chart_na.png" alt="Not applicable pie chart" />
					<figcaption>
						<p><strong>Not applicable:</strong> The following pie chart has visible labels <em>and</em> values that convey equivalent information to the graphical objects (the pie slices): </p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/graphics-contrast_pie-chart_pass.png" alt="Passing pie chart" />
					<figcaption>
						<p><strong>Pass:</strong> The following pie chart has visible labels, and sufficient contrast around and between the slices of the pie chart (the graphical objects): </p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Note that on the last example, the spaces between the small slices is less than 3px wide, therefore those slices need a 4.5:1 contrast ratio against the white background. </p>
