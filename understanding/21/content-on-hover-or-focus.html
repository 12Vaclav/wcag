		<h1>Understanding Content on Hover or Focus</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p class="instructions">This section contains the main explanatory content of the Understanding. It explains why the Guideline or Success Criterion exists and, at a high level, how to meet it.</p>
			
			<p>The intent of this success criterion is...
			Additional content that appears on keyboard focus or mouse hover can present many challenges for users with low vision and others whose mouse accuracy may be low. User techniques can be employed to successfully perceive and interact with such content  as long as certain conditions are met when it  is displayed.</p>
			
			<h3>Visible Trigger</h3>
			<p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that the additional content does not interfere with viewing or operating the trigger.  If the additional content is positioned to cover all or part of its trigger, then users may find the trigger can become much more difficult to perceive or activate due to visual field disruption.  Under magnification, screen area that doesn't trigger the additional content may be the minority, resulting in a difficult user cycle to pan the magnified screen using the mouse without re-triggering the additional content.  Two methods may be used to satisfy this condition and prevent such interference:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Position the additional content so that it does not obscure any of the trigger with the exception of purely decorative content, such as whitespace or a background graphic which provides no information.</li>
			<li>Provide a mechanism to easily dismiss the additional content, such as by pressing escape or a close button. For large popups or </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whenever possible, it is desirable for both methods to be implemented.</p>
			
			<h3>Hoverable</h3>
			<p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that content which may appear on hover of a target may also be hovered itself.  Content which appears on  hover can be difficult or impossible to perceive if a user is required to keep their mouse pointer over the trigger. When the added content is large, magnified views may mean that the user needs to scroll or pan to completely view it, which is impossible unless the user is able to move their pointer off the trigger without the additional content disappearing. Another common situation is when large pointers have been selected via platform settings or assistive technology. Here, the pointer can obscure a significant area of the additional content. A technique to view the content fully in both situations is to move the mouse pointer directly from the trigger onto the new content.  This capability also offers significant advantages for users who utilize screen reader feedback on mouse interactions.  This condition generally implies that the additional content overlaps or is positioned adjacent to the target.</p>
			
			<h3>Persistent</h3>
			<p>Finally, when content on hover or focus contains user interface components that can gain focus, a user technique can be employed to move focus onto the additional content. As long as the addition remains displayed, the view can then be magnified, scrolled, or panned for optimal perception without regard to mouse position. For additional content with multiple clickable items, this also offers the advantage of being able to make and correct a clicking mistake without losing visibility of the additional content.</p>
			
			<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
			<p>This criterion does not attempt to solve such issues when the appearance of the additional content is completely controlled by the user agent. A prominent example is the common behavior of browsers to display the <code>title</code>Â  attribute in HTML as a small tooltip.</p>
			
			<ol>
			<li>Dialogs cannot be popups because they would fail SC 3.2.1, On Focus, by gaining focus on only focus or hover.</li>
			<li>Add more detail to exception (basically when code is supplied but no styling).</li>
			<li>Add language to explain exception for focus condition when user has dismissed the popup and trigger still has focus.</li>
			</ol>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p class="instructions">This explains how following the success criterion benefits particular types of users with disabilities.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Users who view content under magnification</li>
					<li>Users who increase the size of mouse cursors via platform settings or assistive technology.</li>
					<li>Users with low mouse cursor accuracy due to low vision, motor impairment, etc.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Examples in Understanding pages are normally simple lists of hand-waving examples. Sometimes, examples are instead provided in sub-sections with headings. In either case, examples should stay high-level and not get into code specifics, which is for techniques.</p>

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<div class="instructions">
				<p>This section references techniques that can be used to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion. There are sub-sections for sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and failures. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Within each sub-section, there may be "situations" to describe when a set of techniques need to be considered. Remove the sub-section and heading if situations are not used.</li>
					<li>Techniques are provided in an unordered list. Reference techniques by linking to the filename of the technique and using the technique ID as link text. Use unlinked plain text if the technique has not been written yet.</li>
					<li>If more than one technique must be used for full sufficiency, list them in the same bullet separated by "AND".</li>
					<li>If a general technique requires technology-specific techniques to be implemented, end the bullet with "using" and provide a sub-list of those techniques.</li>
					<li>Square brackets indicate optional components.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remove any parts of the template that are not used, such as the section and heading for situations, sub-lists of techniques, or the "AND" construction. Also remove the square brackets around placeholder optional components.</p>
