		<h1>Understanding Animation from Interactions</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>


			<p>When users take an action not normally associated with animation but some animation is triggered, it can cause distraction or nausea. For example, if scrolling a page causes elements to move (other than the normal movement associated with scrolling) it can trigger vestibular disorders, causing nausea and headaches.</p>

			<p>A common examples is where backgrounds move at a different rate to foregrounds (often termed &quote;parallax scrolling&quote;) which can trigger the symptoms of vestibular disorders.</p>

			<p>The criteria <a href="">2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</a> applies when the web page initiates animation, "Animation from interactions" should apply when an interaction of the user initiates animation unexpectedly.</p>

			<p>Note: The impact can be quite severe, triggering nausea, migraine, and potentially needing bed rest to recover.</p>

			<p>The only way for a website not to trigger the effects of a vistubular disorder, is not to use animations that can trigger the symptoms. If the user controls the movement in a webpage (such as scrolling page), </p>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p>People with vestibular disorders are added as beneficiaries as they cannot always anticipate when animation happens, and are negatively affected if there is no warning or way of turning off the animations.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Examples in Understanding pages are normally simple lists of hand-waving examples. Sometimes, examples are instead provided in sub-sections with headings. In either case, examples should stay high-level and not get into code specifics, which is for techniques.</p>

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<div class="instructions">
				<p>This section references techniques that can be used to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion. There are sub-sections for sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and failures. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Within each sub-section, there may be "situations" to describe when a set of techniques need to be considered. Remove the sub-section and heading if situations are not used.</li>
					<li>Techniques are provided in an unordered list. Reference techniques by linking to the filename of the technique and using the technique ID as link text. Use unlinked plain text if the technique has not been written yet.</li>
					<li>If more than one technique must be used for full sufficiency, list them in the same bullet separated by "AND".</li>
					<li>If a general technique requires technology-specific techniques to be implemented, end the bullet with "using" and provide a sub-list of those techniques.</li>
					<li>Square brackets indicate optional components.</li>

				<p>Remove any parts of the template that are not used, such as the section and heading for situations, sub-lists of techniques, or the "AND" construction. Also remove the square brackets around placeholder optional components.</p>
