		<h1>Understanding Purpose of Controls</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>The intent of this success criterion is to allow more support user preferences or user needs.</p>

			<p> For example, having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However, what is familiar for some users may not be for other users, requiring them to learn new symbols. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the icons simple and familiar. </p>
			<p>In another example, browser extensions can add context sensitive help for known controls or hide controls that the user finds hard to use correctly. Auto complete is another example of how knowing what a control is can help the user agent add support. </p>

			<p>Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible. The design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimise their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility requirements (needs).</p>

			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<p>This Success Criterion helps users who need extra support or a familiar interface, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Additional functionality to support the user </li>
				<li> Symbols and graphics with which users are familiar </li>
				<li> Tool tips </li>
				<li> Language users understand </li>
				<li> Fewer features </li>
				<li> Keyboard shortcuts </li>
			</ul>

			<p>We need personalization because:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Different user needs can conflict </li>
				<li> Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them </li>
				<li> Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it </li>
				<li> Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility, but can often be considered boring design </li>
				<li> It allows for the ability to change levels of complexity (increase or decrease) - As skills improve or decrease over time or context. </li>
				<li> It enables us to really meet user needs </li>
			</ul>
			<p>This helps people with many different cognitive disabilities including people with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Language related disabilities </li>
				<li> Memory related disabilities </li>
				<li> Focus and attention related disabilities </li>
				<li> Disabilities that affects executive function and decision making </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Together this can affect 11% of school age people and over half of people over 60 years old - including those with mild cognitive impairments and Age-Associated Memory Impairment (AAMI).</p>
			<p>Research on these benefits can be found at [<a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/6#bib-cudd-1">cudd-1</a>] and the task force's<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/personalization-preferences.html">issue-papers on personalization and preferences</a>. Also see the<a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/ExampleWebPage/">example of an adaptive page</a>.</p>
			<p>An example is a user can be a person growing older whose ability to learn new things has slowed down. This includes learning new interfaces, symbols, and designs. They may also rely on tool tips. So long as the design is one they know they can use the application and stay in the work force. When interfaces change, they may try to learn the new interface, but the cognitive load becomes too great and they need to retire.</p>

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<section id="sufficient">
				<h3>Sufficient</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> Use semantics to provide extra context (<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">COGA Techniques</a> 4.1). EG: &lt;button coga-action="undo" >default&lt;/button> </li>
					<li> Using schema semantics 
						<ul>
							<li> &lt;button type="button" itemprop="<a href="http://schema.org/SendAction">http://schema.org/SendAction</a>" >Send&lt;/button> </li>
							<li> &lt;a rel="next" and rel="prev" > </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li> Using autocorrect on datafields (conforming to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-fe-autocomplete">https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-fe-autocomplete</a>) </li>
					<li> Provide semantics that allows for symbols on key content (<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">COGA Techniques</a> 4.2) </li>
					<li> Using microformats Â <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-event">http://microformats.org/wiki/h-event</a>
					</li>
					<li> Enable user agents to find the version of the content that best fits their needs. </li>

			<section id="advisory">
				<h2>Advisory</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Use of aria-invalid and aria-required </li>
					<li> Use of aria epub on document content </li>
					<li> Use of aria landmarks - but with coga context where supported </li>
				</ul>
