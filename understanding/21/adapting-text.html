         <h2>Intent</h2>
         <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help ensure that people with disabilities who override spacing or font family (also called font face or typeface) can read text. It provides a spacing buffer. Increased spacing between lines, words, and letters has benefits for people who override author settings via user stylesheet, bookmarklet, extension, or application. They may need to change font family (e.g. to a wider one) than the author has set to effectively read text. They may increase spacing between lines, words, and letters to effectively read text. Line spacing also helps with tracking. Tracking is following along lines of text, including getting from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line.</p>
         <p>This SC does not dictate that authors must set all their content to the specified metrics. Rather, it specifies that an author's content has the ability to be set to those metrics without the loss of essential content or functionality. The author requirement is to not to interfere with a user's ability to override the author settings. </p>
         <p>For this Success Criterion the canvas implementation of text is considered  to be <a>images of text</a>.</p>
         <p>Currently, this Success Criterion can not be reliably tested in PDF user agents.</p>

               <li>People with low vision who require increased space between lines, words and letters are to  able to read text.</li>
               <li>Dyslexic readers have increased  reading speed. </li>

         <h2>Examples</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Text is not cut off when increased spacing is applied to text. </li>
            <li>Text does not wrap out of the containing box or cause text to overlap when  increased spacing is applied to text. </li>
            <li>Text  is not absolutely fixed.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The following images show examples of  failures when authors do not take into consideration that users may override spacing to the metrics specified in this Success Criterion.</p>
         <h3>Example 1</h3>
         <p>The bottom portion of the words &quot;Your Needs&quot; is cut off in a heading making that text unreadable. It should read  &quot;We Provide a Mobile Application Service to Meet Your Needs.&quot;</p>
         <figure>
            <figcaption>Figure 1: Text cut off vertically is a failure.</figcaption>
            <img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/images/b/ba/Spacing_cutoff_fail_vertical.png" alt="Heading text truncated vertically." width="420" height="190">
         </figure>
         <h3>Example 2</h3>
         <p>The last portion of  text  is cut off in the following 3 side-by-side  headings. The 1st heading should read &quot;A cog in the wheel.&quot; But it reads &quot;A cog in the whe&quot;. Only half of the second &quot;e&quot; is visible and the letter &quot;l&quot; is completely missing. The  2nd heading should read &quot;A penny for your thoughts&quot;. But it reads &quot;A penny for your&quot;. The 3rd should read &quot;Back to the drawing board.&quot; But it reads &quot;Back to the drawi&quot;.</p>
         <figure>
            <figcaption>Figure 2: Text cut off horizontally is a failure.</figcaption>
            <img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/images/c/c2/Spacing_cutoff_fail_horizontal.png" alt="3 side-by-side headings with truncated text." width="509" height="184">
         </figure>
         <h3>Example 3</h3>
         <p>The last 3 words &quot;Groups and Programs&quot; of the heading "Technologists Seeking Input from Groups and Programs" overlap the following sentence. That sentence should read, &quot;You are invited to share  ideas and areas of interest related to the  integration of technology from a group or program perspective.&quot; But the words &quot;You are invited to share  ideas&quot; are obscured and unreadable.</p>
         <figure>
            <figcaption>Figure 3: Overlapping text is a failure.</figcaption>
            <img src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/images/1/11/Spacing_overlap_fail.png" alt="Heading text overlaps part of paragraph text." width="510" height="170">
         </figure>
         <h3>Example 4</h3>
         <p>Figure 4 illustrates a mega menu that refuses to adapt to  the Success Criterion's metrics. It does not allow for the spacing buffer. The author's original text remains fixed.</p>
