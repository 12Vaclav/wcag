		<h1>Understanding SC 2.5.1 - Pointer Gestures</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that, wherever possible, content can be operated through simple and untimed pointer input gestures. This includes, but is not limited to, input via touch on touchscreens, mouse pointer input, pencil input, or laser pointer input. Some users cannot perform complex and timed pointer gestures (e.g. a swipe gesture, the drawing of a complex path on the screen, or a long press) in a precise manner - they may lack the accuracy or speed necessary to perform it. Further, it may not always be possible for users to perform multi-pointer gestures (e.g. a two-finger pinch/zoom, a split tap, or a two finger rotation). Authors must therefore ensure that their content can be operated without requiring the user to perform timed or complex gestures.

Note: this does not preclude the inclusion of gesture-based interactions; however, if gesture-based operation is supported, then an alternative which only requires a single untimed gesture (such as a mouse click or tap on the screen) or a series of such gestures must be present.</p>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Users who cannot (accurately) perform complex or timed pointer gestures will be able to operate the content.</p></li>
          <li><p>The availability of user interface elements provided as a fallback for complex and timed gestures helps users who may be unaware of the support for complex or timed pointer gestures. This can be beneficial especially for users with cognitive or learning disabilities.</p></li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
				<ul>
        <li><p>A web application including a map view supports the pinch gesture to zoom into the map content and drag gestures to move the visible area. User interface controls offer the operation via [+] and [-] buttons to zoom in and out and arrow buttons to pan stepwise in all directions.</p></li>
        <li><p>A news site has a carousel slider with different news teases that can be browsed via horizontal swipes. It also shows arrow buttons to browse carousel items forwards or backwards.</p></li>
      </ul>

			<h2>Techniques for  SC 2.5.1 - Pointer Gestures</h2>    
				<h3>Sufficient Techniques</h3>			
       <ul>
         <li><p>Do not rely solely on complex pointer gestures that require high precision or specific timings</p></li>
         <li><p>do not rely on multi-pointer gestures;</p></li>
         <li><p>provide alternatives that do not require complex gestures (e.g. additional visible controls that perform the same function as a complex gesture and can be activated by a simple pointer gesture (mouse click, tap).</p></li>
       </ul>

<p>[Note: the techniques M3 and M9 are related and may be combined in 2.1. M3 requires that functionality work without timing or multi gestures, M9 requires it works without tilt, specific pressure, or angle, etc...]</p>
