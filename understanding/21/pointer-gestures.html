		<h1>Understanding Pointer Gestures</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that, wherever possible, content can be operated through simple and untimed pointer input gestures. This includes, but is not limited to, input via touch on touchscreens, mouse pointer input, pencil input, or laser pointer input. Some users cannot perform complex and timed pointer gestures (e.g. a swipe gesture, the drawing of a complex path on the screen, or a long press) in a precise manner - they may lack the accuracy or speed necessary to perform it. Further, it may not always be possible for users to perform multi-pointer gestures (e.g. a two-finger pinch/zoom, a split tap, or a two finger rotation). Authors must therefore ensure that their content can be operated without requiring the user to perform timed or complex gestures.

Note: this does not preclude the inclusion of gesture-based interactions; however, if gesture-based operation is supported, then an alternative which only requires a single untimed gesture (such as a mouse click or tap on the screen) or a series of such gestures must be present.</p>
			<section id="benefits">
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Users who cannot (accurately) perform complex or timed pointer gestures will be able to operate the content.</p></li>
          <li><p>The provision of interface elements provided as a fallback for complex and timed gestures helps users who may be unaware of the support of complex or timed pointer gestures. This can be beneficial especially for users with cognitive or learning disabilities.</p></li>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Examples in Understanding pages are normally simple lists of hand-waving examples. Sometimes, examples are instead provided in sub-sections with headings. In either case, examples should stay high-level and not get into code specifics, which is for techniques.</p>

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<div class="instructions">
				<p>This section references techniques that can be used to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion. There are sub-sections for sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and failures. </p>
				<p>Do not rely solely on complex pointer gestures that require high precision or specific timings; do not rely on multi-pointer gestures; provide alternatives that do not require complex gestures (e.g. additional visible controls that perform the same function as a complex gesture and can be activated by a simple pointer gesture (mouse click, tap).

[Note: the techniques M3 and M9 are related and may be combined in 2.1. M3 requires that functionality work without timing or multi gestures, M9 requires it works without tilt, specific pressure, or angle, etc...]</p>
        
        <ul>
					<li>Within each sub-section, there may be "situations" to describe when a set of techniques need to be considered. Remove the sub-section and heading if situations are not used.</li>
					<li>Techniques are provided in an unordered list. Reference techniques by linking to the filename of the technique and using the technique ID as link text. Use unlinked plain text if the technique has not been written yet.</li>
					<li>If more than one technique must be used for full sufficiency, list them in the same bullet separated by "AND".</li>
					<li>If a general technique requires technology-specific techniques to be implemented, end the bullet with "using" and provide a sub-list of those techniques.</li>
					<li>Square brackets indicate optional components.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remove any parts of the template that are not used, such as the section and heading for situations, sub-lists of techniques, or the "AND" construction. Also remove the square brackets around placeholder optional components.</p>
