		<h1>Understanding Pointer Gestures</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p >It may not always be possible for users to perform specific gestures (e.g. draw a complex path with their finger on a touchscreen) in a precise and timely manner - they may lack the precision/accuracy/speed necessary. Further, it may not always be possible for users to perform multi-pointer gestures (e.g. a two-finger pinch/zoom, three-finger rotation). Authors must ensure that their content/functionality can be operated without requiring the user to perform timed or complex gestures.

Note: this does not preclude the inclusion of gesture-based interactions; however, if gesture-based controls are used, then an alternative which only requires a single activation/tap must be present.</p>
			<section id="benefits">
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p >Users who cannot (accurately) perform complex or timed pointer gestures (such as touchscreen swipes or multi-pointer gestures such as a two-finger pinch/zoom) will be able to operate content/functionality.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p class="instructions">Examples in Understanding pages are normally simple lists of hand-waving examples. Sometimes, examples are instead provided in sub-sections with headings. In either case, examples should stay high-level and not get into code specifics, which is for techniques.</p>

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<div class="instructions">
				<p>This section references techniques that can be used to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion. There are sub-sections for sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and failures. </p>
				<p>Do not rely solely on complex pointer gestures that require high precision or specific timings; do not rely on multi-pointer gestures; provide alternatives that do not require complex gestures (e.g. additional visible controls that perform the same function as a complex gesture and can be activated by a simple pointer gesture (mouse click, tap).

[Note: the techniques M3 and M9 are related and may be combined in 2.1. M3 requires that functionality work without timing or multi gestures, M9 requires it works without tilt, specific pressure, or angle, etc...]</p>
        
        <ul>
					<li>Within each sub-section, there may be "situations" to describe when a set of techniques need to be considered. Remove the sub-section and heading if situations are not used.</li>
					<li>Techniques are provided in an unordered list. Reference techniques by linking to the filename of the technique and using the technique ID as link text. Use unlinked plain text if the technique has not been written yet.</li>
					<li>If more than one technique must be used for full sufficiency, list them in the same bullet separated by "AND".</li>
					<li>If a general technique requires technology-specific techniques to be implemented, end the bullet with "using" and provide a sub-list of those techniques.</li>
					<li>Square brackets indicate optional components.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remove any parts of the template that are not used, such as the section and heading for situations, sub-lists of techniques, or the "AND" construction. Also remove the square brackets around placeholder optional components.</p>
