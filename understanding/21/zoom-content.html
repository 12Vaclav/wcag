	<h1>Understanding Zoom Content</h1>
	<section id="intent">
		<h2>Intent</h2>

		<p>Authors support the resizing and reflow of content as allowed by the browser.</p>

		<p>Zoom functionality in browsers allows users to increase the size of all content. When appropriately authored the content can reflow (wrap) to stay within view without scrolling both horizontally and vertically. The spatial relationships of the content can vary, but all content and functionality should continue to be available within the viewport (window) of supporting browsers.</p>

		<p><strong>NB:</strong> Small screen (mobile) devices are by necessity limited in how they can resize content and may not support content-reflow when zooming. This success criteria is to ensure the content is capable of resizing to a reasonable degree. In practice people will need to use a device or user-agent capable of reflowing content such as a desktop or laptop computer.</p>

		<p>The size 400% (starting from 1280 CSS pixels wide) was picked as the largest size a standard website can get to using responsive design. In a browser on a desktop operative system, content that can reflow will display the page at 400% as though it were 320 CSS pixels wide). If the user needs to increase content more than 400%, then a complete <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/wiki/Reflow_to_Single_Column">linearisation</a> would be necessary which completely overrides the layout of the website. </p>

		<p>Technologies like HTML/CSS, PDF and ePub have methods of reflowing content to fit the width of the user-agent window. When zooming in on HTML/CSS content, pixels increase in size, so an element that is 200 pixels wide at 200% takes 400 pixels of the width on screen.</p>

		<p>A significant proportion of people with low vision need more than a 200% increase in the size of content. From the <a href="http://webaim.org/projects/lowvisionsurvey/#magnification">Webaim survey</a> 25% of low vision users indicated needing magnification to 400% or more, which is probably more than the total number of screen reader users. (It is 42% for 300% or more).</p>

		<p>The impact of horizontal scrolling can <a href="http://nosetothepage.org/Fitz/2dScroll.html">increase the effort required to read by 40-100 times</a>, so avoiding scrolling should be the aim whenever feasible.</p>

		<p>The testing parameters are more defined than WCAG 2.0's 1.4.4, where the test should start with a browser at 1280px wide, and then zoom in to 400%. In desktop browsers that means your view is then 320px wide, equivalent to a mobile device. Many sites currently cater to that range of sizes, and that number will only increase as more sites update to be mobile friendly. What is not achieved by being mobile-friendly is testing under landscape orientation, rather than assuming a (portrait) mobile device.</p>

		<p>It is also possible to meet this success criteria in PDF files by using the reflow feature of Acrobat Reader, which works well on many tagged PDFs with a defined order and structure. ePub files are designed to reflow so should be able to meet this criteria easily.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Wikipedia - As of 2015 there were 940 million people with some degree of vision loss.<sup id="cite_ref-GBD2015Pre_4-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment#cite_note-GBD2015Pre-4">[4]</a></sup> 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind.<sup id="cite_ref-WHO2014_3-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment#cite_note-WHO2014-3">[3]</a></sup></li>
			<li>Zoom features in browsers make content on the page larger which helps people with mild, moderate and even quite severe vision impairments. A person can make everything bigger or smaller as  needed. Zoom is the default method in all desktop browsers to increase the size of content. Mobile browsers (small screen devices) tend to use pinch-zoom, or a text-size setting in the accessibility preferences.</li>
			<li>Horizontal scrolling makes reading difficult for people with low vision, or cognitive disorders, or people on mobile devices. Horizontal scrolling can <a href="http://nosetothepage.org/Fitz/2dScroll.html">increase the effort required to read by 40-100 times</a>, so avoiding scrolling should be the aim whenever feasible.</li>
			<li>Some people need to increase the size of all content in order to perceive information. </li>
