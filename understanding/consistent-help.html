         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#consistent-help" style="font-weight: bold;">3.2.6 Consistent Help</a> (Level A): If a <a href="#dfn-web-page">web page</a> contains any of the following help mechanisms, and those mechanisms are repeated
            on multiple web pages within a <a href="#dfn-set-of-web-pages">set of web pages</a>, they occur in the same relative order to other page content, unless a change is
            initiated by the user:

            via a direct link to a different page containing the information.
         </p>
         <p class="note">For this Success Criterion, the same relative order can be thought of as how the content
            is ordered when the page is serialized. The visual position of a help mechanism is
            likely to be consistent across pages for the same page variation (e.g., CSS break-point).
            The user can cause a change, for example zoom or change orientation, which may trigger
            a different page variation.

            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

         </section>
         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure users can find help for completing
               tasks on a Web site, when it is available. This is distinct from interface-level help,
               such as contextual help, features like spell checkers, and instructional text in a
               form. 
            </p>
            <p>Locating the help mechanism in a consistent location across pages makes it easier
               for users to find it.  For example, when a mechanism or link is located in the header
               of one Web page, it will be easier to find if it is in the header of other pages.
               The help mechanism, such as a contact phone number, may be provided directly on the
               page but it may also be a direct link to a different contact page. Regardless of which
               approach is used, the mechanism must be located in the same relative order on each
               page within the set of pages.
            </p>
            <p>When testing this Success Criterion, it is the help item which is relative to the
               rest of the content. When testing a page, other content that is present across the
               set of web pages and is before the help item should be before the help item on this
               page. Items which are after the help item on other pages should be after the help
               item on this page.
            </p>
            <p>The location in a smaller viewport may be different than in a larger viewport but
               it is best if the mechanism or link is consistent across a set of web pages. A consistent
               location, both visually and programmatically, is the most usable.
            </p>
            <p>When having problems completing a task on a Web site (or part of a Web site, what
               we call a <a href="#dfn-set-of-web-pages">set of Web pages</a>), people with some types of disabilities may not be able to work through the issue
               without further help.  Issues could include difficulty:
               			completing a form, or finding a document or page which provides information required
               to complete a task.
            </p>
            <p>Without help, some users may abandon the task. They may also fail to correctly complete
               a task, or they may require assistance from people who do not necessarily keep private
               information secure.
            </p>
            <p>It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require authors to provide help
               / access to help. The Criterion only requires that when one of the listed forms of
               help is available across multiple pages that it be in a consistent location. It does
               not require authors to provide help information on PDFs or other static documents
               that may be available for viewing/download from the Web pages. It is also not the
               intent to require contact information if:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A Web site is not supported,</li>
               				
               <li>Content is archived, or </li>
               
               <li>When finding help would invalidate the activity, such as in a testing situation. </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>It is also not the intent of this Success Criterion to require a human be available
               at all times. If the human contact is not available during certain hours or certain
               days, information should be provided so the user can tell when it will be available.

            <ul>
               
               <li>This Success Criterion helps people who may have difficulty locating help that is
                  not part of the page they are using. Ensuring they can connect with help allows them
                  to complete the task.
               </li>
               
               <li>When a user can easily find help for their specific questions, they are more successful
                  completing tasks.
               </li>
               
               <li>Users that experience cognitive fatigue or cognitive shut down will be able to reserve
                  their energy for the task, instead of using it to find support.
               </li>
               
               <li>Enabling users (especially those with cognitive disabilities) to find solutions while
                  expressing their question using their own words increases their chances of success
                  for completing a task.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>Self help methods beyond the site, such as using internet search to find the contact
               information for an organization, can be too difficult. Further, the user’s disability
               may make it more difficult to find the help available (such as a “contact us” link,
               phone number, or support page) if the information is not present within a few interactions
               (e.g., displayed in the header, or via a menu). In addition, for some users with disabilities,
               struggling to complete a task on a site may cause additional cognitive challenges
               when searching for help within the site.
            </p>
            <p>When a user is quickly able to find help, they are able to complete the task even
               if they encounter challenges.
            </p>
            <p>Typical help mechanisms include:</p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Human contact details such as a phone number, email address, hours of operation.</li>
               
               <li>Human contact mechanism such as a messaging system, chat client, contact form, social
                  media channel.
               </li>
               
               <li>Self-help option such as an up-to-date Frequently Asked Questions, How Do I page,
                  Support page.
               </li>
               
               <li>A fully automated contact mechanism such as a chatbot.</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>The order of the types of help listed in the Success Criterion does not imply priority.</p>
            <p>The human contact details enable users to connect with the  organization or the part
               of the organization that can assist with the content. For example, an online jobs
               / recruitment portal may provide a contact method for the team that supports the recruitment
               portal and not a catch-all for the entire company. Each layer of contact added prolongs
               the time before the user will receive help.
            </p>
            <p>The human contact mechanism enables a person to express what they are looking for
               using their own words. For some with cognitive disabilities, this may be the best
               way for them to find an answer to their problem.
            </p>
            <p>For pages for which no human support is available, it is best if a self-help option
               says that no human support is available.  Self-help options can go beyond allowing
               the user to search within the site. Contextual help is still recommended (See Success
               Criterion 3.3.5 for more information) but a self-help option provides a single location
               that makes it easier for people with cognitive disabilities to understand what help
               is available without having to hunt for it. While some people may easily be able to
               identify that no support would be available for a particular type of Web site, this
               may not be apparent to some users with disabilities.
            </p>
            <p>Chatbots can work more effectively for everyone, and particularly for people with
               cognitive disabilities if they:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>recognize misspelled words,</li>
               
               <li>provide human contact details if the chatbot is unable to provide a satisfactory response
                  after 3 attempts, and
               </li>
               
               <li>be dismissed with a single interaction, and recalled using a link or button.</li>
               
            </ul>

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>On-line job application - Some of the application questions may be hard for new job
                  seekers to understand even after reading the contextual help. For example, the form
                  may request their identification number, but they may have several and not know which
                  one to enter. Easily findable contact information will enable them to use phone or
                  email so they can get an answer to their question.
               </li>
               
               <li>Medical appointment scheduling form - When the service a patient is trying to book
                  is not easily findable within the interface, they may need human help. A built-in
                  messaging option (chat client) enables them to quickly interact with a staff person
                  that can help, without requiring them to manage a second interface.
               </li>
               
               <li>Finding a specific policy or procedure - An employee who needs to complete a work
                  task may have difficulty locating the specific policy or procedure document on their
                  employer’s Web site. A How Do I page may include the information that enables them
                  to independently complete this task.

                        Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
                        The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
                        that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
                        target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
                        provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
                        of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
                        to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
                        markup into identifiable bundles.
