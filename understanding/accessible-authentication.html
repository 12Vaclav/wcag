            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion is to ensure there is an accessible, easy-to-use,
               and secure method to log in, access content, and undertake tasks. Most web sites rely
               on usernames and passwords for logging in. Memorizing a username and password (or
               transcribing it manually) places a very high or impossible burden upon people with
               certain cognitive disabilities.
            </p>
            <p>Remembering a site-specific password is a <a href="#dfn-cognitive-function-test">cognitive function test</a>. Such tests are known to be problematic for many people with cognitive disabilities.
               Whether it is remembering random strings of characters, a pattern gesture to perform
               on a touch screen, or identifying which images include a particular object, cognitive
               function tests will exclude some people. When a cognitive function test is used, at
               least one other authentication method must be available which is not a cognitive function
               test.
            </p>
            <p>If there is more than one step in the authentication process, such as with multi-factor
               authentication, all steps should comply with this Success Criterion. There should
               be a path through authentication that does not rely on cognitive function tests.
            </p>
            <p>Being able to recover or change the email and password is an important part of authentication.
               If the user is authenticating with alternative information in order to recover their
               account, there needs to be a method that is not a cognitive function test.
            </p>
            <p>Many organizations are required to use 2-factor authentication that combines independent
               sources to confirm a userâ€™s identity. These sources can consist of combining authentication
               through:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>knowledge (e.g., password, letters in a passphrase or memorized swipe path);</li>
               
               <li>possession (e.g., through receipt of a one time password generated, or received on
                  a device, or scanning of a QR code on an external device);
               </li>
               
               <li>biometrics (e.g., fingerprint scanning, facial recognition or keystroke dynamics).</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>Most knowledge-based authentication methods rely on a cognitive function test and
               so mechanisms to assist users must be available. When authentication relies on performing
               an action on a separate device, it should be possible to complete the action without
               the need to transcribe information. It may not be possible to know what device-based
               authentication methods are available to a user; offering a choice of methods can allow
               them to choose the path that most suits them.
            </p>
            <p>Web sites can employ username (or email) and password inputs as an authentication
               method if it enables the user agent (browsers and third-party password managers) to
               fill in the fields automatically. If the login form meets <a href="identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a>, and the form controls have an appropriate accessible name in accordance with <a href="name-role-value">Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>, the user agent can reliably recognize the fields and automatically fill them in.
               However, if the user agent is blocked from filling in the fields by a script then
               the page would not pass this criterion because it prevents the mechanism from working.
            </p>
            <p>Copy and paste can be relied on to avoid transcription. Users can copy their login
               credentials from a local source (such as a standalone third-party password manager)
               and paste it into the username and password fields on a login form, or into a web-based
               command line interfaces asking for a password. Blocking people from pasting into authentication
               fields, or using a different format between the copied text and the input field (for
               example, "Enter the 3rd, 4th, and 6th character of your password"), would force the
               user to transcribe information and therefore fail this criterion, unless another method
               is available.
            </p>
            <p>If a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">CAPTCHA</a> is used as part of an authentication process, there must be a method that does not
               include a cognitive function test. If the test is based on something the website has
               set such as remembering or transcribing a word, or recognizing a picture the website
               provided, that would be a cognitive functional test. Recognizing objects, or a picture
               the user has provided is a cognitive function test, however, it is excepted at the
               AA level. Some forms of object recognition may require an understanding of a particular
               culture. For example, taxis can appear differently in different locales. This is an
               issue for many people, including people with disabilities, but it is not considered
               an accessibility-specific issue.
            </p>
            <p>Some CAPTCHAs and cognitive function tests used for authentication may only appear
               in certain situations, such as when ad blockers are present, or after repeated incorrect
               password entry. This criterion applies when these tests are used regardless of whether
               they are used every time or only triggered by specific scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>Another factor that can contribute to cognitive load is hiding characters when typing.
               Although this criterion requires that users do not have to type in (transcribe) a
               password, there are scenarios where that is necessary such as creating a password
               to be saved by a password manager. Providing a feature to optionally show a password
               can improve the chance of success for some people with cognitive disabilities or those
               who have difficulties with accurately typing.

            <p>People with cognitive issues relating to memory, reading (for example, dyslexia),
               numbers (for example, dyscalculia), or perception-processing limitations will be able
               to authenticate irrespective of the level of their cognitive abilities.

         <section id="examples">
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A web site uses a properly marked up username (or email) and password fields as the
                  login authentication (meeting <a href="identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a> and <a href="name-role-value">Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value</a>). The user's browser or integrated third-party password manager extension can identify
                  the purpose of the inputs and automatically fill in the username and password.
               </li>
               
               <li>A web site does not block paste functionality. The user is able to use a third-party
                  password manager to store credentials, copy them, and paste them directly into a login
                  form.
               </li>
               
               <li>A web site uses WebAuthn so the user can authenticate with their device instead of
                  username/password. The user's device could use any available modality. Common methods
                  on laptops and phones are facial-scan, fingerprint, and PIN (Personal Identification
                  Number). The web site is not enforcing any particular use, it is assumed a user will
                  setup a method that suits them.
               </li>
               
               <li>A web site offers the ability to login with a third-party provider using the OAuth
                  method.
               </li>
               
               <li>A web site that requires two-factor authentication allows for multiple options for
                  the 2nd factor, including a USB-based method where the user simply presses a button
                  to enter a time-based token.
               </li>
               
               <li>A web site that requires two-factor authentication displays a QR code which can be
                  scanned by an app on a user's device to confirm identity.
               </li>
               
               <li>A web site that requires two-factor authentication sends a notification to a user's
                  device. The user must use their device's authentication mechanism (for example, user-defined
                  PIN, fingerprint, facial recognition) to confirm identity.
               </li>
