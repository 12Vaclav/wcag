         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#accessible-authentication" style="font-weight: bold;">3.3.7 Accessible Authentication</a> (Level A): For each step in an authentication process that relies on a <a href="#dfn-cognitive-function-test">cognitive function test</a>, at least one other authentication method is available that does not rely on a cognitive

            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure there is an accessible, easy-to-use,
               and secure method to log in and access content. Most web sites rely on usernames and
               passwords for logging in. Memorizing a username and password (or transcribing it manually)
               places a very high or impossible burden upon people with certain cognitive disabilities.
            </p>
            <p>Remembering a site-specific password is a <a href="#dfn-cognitive-function-test">cognitive function test</a>. Such tests are known to be problematic for many people with cognitive disabilities.
               Whether it is remembering random strings of characters, a pattern gesture to perform
               on a touch screen, or identifying which images include a particular object, cognitive
               function tests will exclude some people. When a cognitive function test is used, at
               least one other authentication method must be available which is not a cognitive function
               test.
            </p>
            <p>If there is more than one step in the authentication process, such as with multi-factor
               authentication, all steps should comply with this success criterion. There should
               be a path through authentication that does not rely on cognitive function tests.
            </p>
            <p>Being able to recover or change the email and password is an important part of authentication.
               If the user is authenticating with alternative information in order to recover their
               account, there needs to be a method that is not a cognitive function test.
            </p>
            <p>Web sites can employ username (or email) and password inputs as an authentication
               method if it enables the user-agent (browsers and 3rd party password managers) to
               fill in the fields automatically. If the login form meets <a href="identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a>, and the form controls have an appropriate accessible name in accordance with <a href="name-role-value">Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>, the user-agent can reliably recognize the fields and automatically fill them in.
               However, if the user-agent is blocked from filling in the fields by a script then
               the page would not pass this criterion because it prevents the mechanism from working.
            </p>
            <p>Copy and paste can be relied on to avoid transcription. Users can copy their login
               credentials from a local source (such as a standalone 3rd party password manager)
               and paste it into the username and password fields on a login form, or into a web-based
               command line interfaces asking for a password. Blocking people from pasting into authentication
               fields, or using a different format between the copied text and the input field (e.g.
               "Enter the 3rd, 4th, and 6th character of your password"), would force the user to
               transcribe information and therefore fail this criterion.
            </p>
            <p>If a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">CAPTCHA</a> is used as part of an authentication process, there must be a method that does not
               include a cognitive function test. If the test is based on something the website has
               set such as remembering or transcribing a word, or recognizing a picture the website
               provided, that would be a cognitive functional test. Recognizing common objects, or
               a picture the user has provided, would not be a cognitive functional test. Some forms
               of object recognition may require an understanding of a particular culture. For example,
               taxis can appear differently in different locales. This is an issue for many people,
               including people with disabilities, but it is not considered an accessibility-specific
               issue.
            </p>
            <p>Some CAPTCHAs and cognitive function tests used for authentication may only appear
               in certain situations, such as when ad blockers are present, or after repeated incorrect
               password entry. This criterion applies when these tests are used regardless of whether
               they are used every time or only triggered by specific scenarios.

            <p>People with cognitive issues relating to memory, reading (e.g. dyslexia), numbers
               (e.g. dyscalculia), or perception-processing limitations will be able to authenticate
               irrespective of the level of their cognitive abilities.

         <section id="examples">
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A web site uses a properly marked up username (or email) and password fields as the
                  login authentication (meeting <a href="identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a> and <a href="name-role-value">Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value</a>). The user's browser or integrated 3rd party password manager extension can identify
                  the purpose of the inputs and automatically fill in the username and password.
               </li>
               
               <li>A web site does not block paste functionality. The user is able to use a 3rd party
                  password manager to store credentials, copy them, and paste them directly into a login
                  form.
               </li>
               
               <li>A web site uses WebAuthn so the user can authenticate with their device instead of
                  username/password. The user's device could use any available modality. Common methods
                  on laptops and phones are facial-scan, fingerprint, and pin number. The web site is
                  not enforcing any particular use, it is assumed a user will setup a method that suits
                  them.
               </li>
               
               <li>A web site offers the ability to login with a 3rd party provider using the OAuth method.</li>
               
               <li>A web site that requires 2-factor authentication allows for multiple options for the
                  2nd factor, including a USB-based method where the user simply presses a button to
                  enter a time-based token.
