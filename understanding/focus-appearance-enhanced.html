            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is highly
               visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="./focus-appearance-minimum.html">Success Criterion 2.4.11 Focus Appearance (Minimum)</a> and defines a higher level of visibility for the focus indicator.
            </p>
            <p>In relation to Focus Visible (enhanced) this criterion:</p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Expands the minimum area to 2 CSS pixels around the perimeter.</li>
               
               <li>Increases the change of contrast to 4.5:1.</li>
               
               <li>Does not allow for any part of the focus indicator to be obscured by other, author-created
                  content.
               </li>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>

               <li>Sighted keyboard users can visually determine which component will be interacted with
                  using keyboard operations.

               <li>People with low vision are better able to follow a highly visible focus indicator.</li>
               
               <li>People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in
                  executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.
