            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>For sighted people who use a keyboard or keyboard-like device (e.g., a switch, voice
               input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. However, when progressing
               through a page, other content may potentially hide the focused element. This Success
               Criterion ensures that the item receiving focus is not entirely hidden by other content
               created by the author.
            </p>
            <p>This AA Success Criterion requires that at least some part of the component (and as
               result, normally part of its focus indicator as well) not be obscured by other author-created
               content. The AAA version requires that the entire focus indicator of the component
               not be obscured by other author-created content.
            </p>
            <p>Ideally any overlap of the component receiving focus by other content will be avoided.
               However, in recognition of the complex responsive designs common today, the minimum
               version of this requirement requires only that where other content overlaps an item
               receiving focus, it not do so entirely. Typical types of content that can overlap
               focused items are sticky footers, sticky headers, or non-modal dialogs. As a user
               tabs through the page, these layers of content can obscure the focused item and its
               focus indicator.
            </p>
            <p>A notification implemented as sticky content, such as a cookie banner, will fail this
               Success Criterion if it obscures an element with focus. Ways of passing include making
               the banner modal so the user has to dismiss the banner before navigating through the
               page, or using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap/#propdef-scroll-padding">scroll padding</a> so the banner does not overlap other content. Notifications that do not require user
               action could also meet this criterion by closing (dismissed) on loss of focus.
            </p>
            <p>Another form of obscuring can occur due to light boxes or other semi-opaque effects
               overlapping the item with focus. While less than 100 percent opacity is not causing
               the component to be "entirely hidden," such semi-opaque overlaps may cause a failure
               of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance.html">2.4.11 Focus Appearance</a>. When a focus indicator can be covered by a semi-opaque component, the ability of
               the focus indicator to pass 2.4.11 should be evaluated (and pass) while the focus
               indicator is under the semi-opaque component. The intention in both situations is
               that the component receiving focus should never be obscured to the point a user cannot
               tell which item has focus.

               <p>If the interface is configurable so that the user can move toolbars and non-modal
                  dialogs around, then only the initial positions of user-movable content would be considered
                  for testing and conformance of this Success Criterion.

               <li>This Success Criterion allows many who rely on a keyboard to operate the page by letting
                  them visually determine the component on which keyboard operations will interact at
                  any point in time. This includes people with low vision and/or mobility impairments,
                  who may rely on keyboard emulators including speech input, sip-and-puff software,
                  onscreen keyboards, scanning software, and a variety of assistive technologies and
                  alternate keyboards.
