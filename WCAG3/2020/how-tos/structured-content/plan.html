				<h2>Planning responsibilities</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure that people can quickly find information within your product's text. </li>
					<li>Headings make it easier for people to find information. Too many headings, disorganized headings, or headings without a navigational focus make it more difficult. Review heading content and relevance in your usability testing.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Tips for collaboration</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Editors and Content Managers know how to keep headings focused on structure.</li>
					<li>Search Engine Optimizers (SEO) know how to maximize the increase in search engine visibility provided by headings.  However, the ability to leverage this increase cannot cause any heading guidelines to be broken.</li>
					<li>Designers submit an appropriate organization and heading design as part of the overall product design.</li>
					<li>Developers use semantic heading elements -- not just text that is visually styled as a heading.</li>
					<li>UX team knows to evaluate content organization.</li>
					<li>QA testers know to test for appropriate heading structure, including semantic code evaluation.</li>
				</ul>

					<h3>How to get started early</h3>
					<p>Early project meetings need to discuss accessibility and the importance of improving the usability of the site for people with disabilities. Writing, designing, and coding well organized text content will help all users. </p>

					<h3>How to remediate</h3>
					<p>The most common problem with headings are:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Visually styled headings that are not semantic.  This prevents assistive technology (like screen readers) from being able to tell that the text is a heading. The developers need to research the appropriate semantic code. In HTML, that would be an h tag at some level between 1 and 6. For other technologies, see the Method for that technology.</li>
						<li>Headings that are semantic, but coded at an inappropriate level.  For example, jumping from an h2 tag to an h4 tag.</li>
						<li>Headings that contain irrelevant information to the text below the heading.  For example, an h3 tag that says “win a vacation” when the subsequent paragraph is about repairing cotton candy machines.</li>
						<li>Headings that have been chosen for styling over navigation.  For example, “For the Win” being set to an h2 because h2 font styling is desirable for that text, not because it is naturally content that should be associated with a heading tag.</li>
						<li>Headings that are too long.  While there is no fixed character length for headings, they should not contain an entire paragraph.</li>
					</ol>
