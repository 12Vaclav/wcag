				<h2>Planning responsibilities</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Prior to finalizing the project budget, consider possible costs associated with developing accessible content, written in clear language. </li>
					<li>During project planning, coordinate efforts with the project team to organize and schedule the approach to creating content written in clear words . Considerations to discuss:
					<ul>
						<li>If possible, secure content authors or editors with experience writing in plain language</li>
						<li>Direct content authors to the clear words guideline</li>
						<li>Provide training on how to develop content that uses plain language principles. Determine if you will create a style guide to clearly communicate the unique needs of your content. Plan and schedule iterative plain language quality assurance checks throughout the project cycle. Schedule time for cycles of editing.</li>
						<li>If your content requires legal review, bring in legal experts early so they agree with using plain language.</li>
						<li>If your content uses a lot of technical terms, idioms, jargon, metaphors or sarcasm, plan the time to write clear words summaries.</li>
						<li>You may need a glossary section to define terms. This will need to be designed and coded.</li>
					</ul></li>

				<h2>Tips for collaboration</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Work with the design team to include visually and semantically distinct heading structure (see Headings) and ability to display definitions of terms and summaries. </li>
					<li>Decide if you will do studies to gather end user feedback that includes people with disabilities. If so, develop a schedule and process for obtaining and integrating the feedback. </li>
					<li>Decide which approach will be used to evaluate clear words. For example, one or more of the following approaches could be used:
					<ul>
						<li>Use an professional editor</li>
						<li>If a style guide exists, use this to evaluate clear language</li>
						<li>Use the  method <a href="">Use Clear Words</a> <span class="ednote"> - written, not coded yet </span></li>
					</ul></li>
