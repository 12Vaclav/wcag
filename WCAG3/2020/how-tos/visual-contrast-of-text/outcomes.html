				<li>Select font characteristics and background colors to provide enough contrast</li>
				<li>Select font characteristics and background colors to provide enough contrast. Also verify that both the font color and background is set. If the background is an image, affirm that the color is close to the image in case the image fails to load.</li>
				<li>Use the <a href="https://www.myndex.com/SAPC/">APCA Contrast tool</a> to test different pairs of colors.</li>
				<li>Use of transparency will affect how colors render, so the CSS color values themselves will not predict contrast accurately. In these cases, using a digital color meter (eyedropper), inspect the color value as rendered and use that in the APCA tool.</li>        
				<li>Visually compare potential font selections against the "standard" fonts types listed in the visual contrast matrix, and note any perceived contrast difference for a given weight and size. </li>
				<li>Test media queries to ensure different devices render the expected font size and weight. This is especially important if using units such as em or vw.</li>
				<li>Take a screen shot of the content design, then use a <a href="https://www.myndex.com/CVD/">CVD Simulator</a> to see how that content appears to different types of color vision deficiencies (aka color blindness).</li>
				<li>Use default fonts and colors</li>
				<li>Use default fonts and colors but if defaults are to be used, the CSS cascade and inline styles must be checked to confirm that neither the font nor the background is set.</li>
				<li>Compare potential font selections with the "standard" fonts types listed in the visual contrast matrix, and note any perceived difference for a given weight and size. </li>
				<li>If the designer will be using relative units such as em or vw, plan to use media queries to ensure fonts render at the correct size on difference resolutions.</li>
				<li>Create a flow chart reference of the CSS structure to indicate the best points to set property values such as color or size, and best placement for media queries.</li>
