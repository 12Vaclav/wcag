				<h3>Languages that use CSS for styling:</h3>
				<p>In CSS, size text using relative units such as rem and em for text sizing and margins. If a user scales their browser’s text size, text sized in relative elements will resize and still keep their visual connectedness. Line heights are unitless so that they are based on the size of the computed size of the text and will also adapt with any text resizing.</p>

				<h3>Plain text with markdown</h3>
				<p>Markdown syntax can create headings that can be converted into multiple other formats. Because markdown documents are frequently converted into other formats, spacing is more important than purely plain-text documents. Headings in markdown should have one line of blank space before them and no space after them. The # symbol is used to create six levels of headings. </p>
<pre>
# Heading level one
## Heading level two
### Heading level three
#### Heading level four
##### Heading level five
###### Heading level six

# An exciting document title
Here’s the introduction to the document, hopefully with a summary to help readers understand if the contents will be useful to them.

## Here’s an interesting second-level heading
This is the beginning of an interesting paragraph of text that you, dear reader, will hopefully enthuse about.
