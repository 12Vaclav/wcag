				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Images and graphics can make content more pleasant and easier to understand, especially for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. People with low vision and other visual impairments also use images to orient themselves in the content. However, images can create major barriers when they are not accessible.Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. This ensures that images can be used by people with various disabilities. </p>
