			<h2>Critical Failures</h2>
			<p>Video that is on the path that is essential for completing the task that does not have captioning is a critical failure.  For example, an education site with a video that a student will be tested on or a shopping experience of previewing movies. If they do not have captioning (closed or open captioning), they fail.   </p>
